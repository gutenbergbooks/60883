  <h2 class='c006'>I.<br /> <span class='large'>THE TRANSPORT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“There come the tug-boats, Colonel,” says an officer,
as I stand on the deck of the “Alice Counce,” waiting for
my regiment. I am a stranger to it, and only assume
command to-day. From the East river come the boats,
laden as many other boats have been, with a dark swarm
of men, who cover the deck and hang upon the bulwarks.</p>

<p class='c011'>The boats come alongside and throw their lines to the
ship, and then rises a concord of those sounds that
generally start with a new regiment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Attention!</span> Officers and men will remain on board
the boats till ordered aboard the ship. Captains of A
and F will march their companies aboard and conduct
them to their quarters. The bunks of each are marked
with their Company letter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The hubbub ends, and the companies climb successively
aboard, and stumble down into the dark hold,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>where, cold and clammy from recent scrubbings, are certain
rough bunks, each so contrived as thoroughly to
make four men unhappy. Unhappy! for the bunks are
three tiers thick between decks, leaving no room
wherein to sit up and be sick—and four men in one bed
never did and never will lie still. Those who have
never been to sea before, dream not of what awaits
them!</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet the men surprise me with the great good humor
in which they seek out and take possession of their dark
quarters. On one side, beginning at the sternmost
bulkhead, Co. “A,” with the aid of dingy ship-lanterns,
stows away the baggage, and next to it is “F,” at the
same work. This order of the companies has a reason;
for in line of battle, they are assorted in pairs, called
“divisions,” so that each division shall contain one of
the five senior and one of the five junior captains. In
camp too they occupy the same places as in line of
battle, and hence this is the proper guide for assigning
quarters on ship board. Beginning on one side at the
extreme stern with “A,” we run round the ship until at
the extreme stern on the opposite side we finish with
“B.” There is some difference in the comfort of the
bunks; somebody must have the worst, and it is very
desirable that this somebody shall blame for it only his
own bad luck.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shall we weigh anchor soon, Captain?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can’t tell, sir. No wind now. Looks as though a
fog were coming down. Can’t sail till we’ve a wind.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>“Colonel,” says one of the Captains, “my first-lieutenant
has not been out of camp for six weeks. If you
will let him go ashore, I shall be much obliged.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I cannot, Captain; the ship is ordered to sail immediately.
While this is possible, no officer can leave.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Colonel,” says another, “Lieutenant A., of my company,
learnt last evening that his mother is quite ill.
“Will you approve this pass?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am sorry to say, Captain, that no officer can leave
the ship. We are under sailing orders—the pilot is on
board—the tug within hail, and we shall weigh anchor
whenever the wind freshens.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is really very hard.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Colonel,” says a third, “my first-sergeant’s wife is
very ill. I told him that he could go back and see her,
and get his things this morning. If you will approve
this pass, I shall be very much obliged.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He must send for his things. We are under sailing
orders. No one can leave the ship.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The poor fellow promised her that he would certainly
be back to-day. It was the only way he could
make her consent to his coming. He is a most faithful
fellow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mate, do you think we can possibly sail to-night?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, sir; fog won’t rise afore midnight. Pilot’s gone
ashore.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, Captain, let your sergeant take this dispatch
to head-quarters, and report on board at daylight.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>The fog grows denser and denser—the rain comes
down; such dreary refusals and disappointments have
filled the day. The cabin will not hold half the officers.
Nothing is settled—all is dirt, disorder and confusion.
Oh, what a wretched, moody, miserable day!</p>

<p class='c011'>A week of such days passes, but at last the fresh west
wind blows keen and cold. A little tug comes out from
among the piers, and seizing the great vessel, leads her
towards the Narrows, and the regiment at last is moving
to New Orleans.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall be glad,” says a young lieutenant, flushed
with the thought of setting forth on his first campaign,
“I shall be glad when we are out of sight of New
York.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’ll be gladder when you come in sight of it
again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps I shall,” he says, with a laugh; “but after
all our working and waiting, it’s delightful to be off at
last.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I stand on the deck watching the sinking city and the
lessening shores, as many have done before me, while
gliding down the beautiful bay, until they grow dim in
the distance, and then turn away, to think of inspections,
rations, fires, and sea-sickness.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first night has passed without incident or accident,
extinguishing the excitement of our sailing and
leaving us to wake up quietly for our first day at sea.
Not “quietly,” for twenty drummer boys, without the
faintest sign of sea-sickness, rattled out a reveille that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>frightened the rats from their holes, and brought the
sleeping watch from the forecastle, and disturbed every
sailor and sleeper in the ship. It left us wide awake,
and ready for the routine and duties of the day.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Breakfast!</span>—Breakfast is no easy thing to get in a
transport ship. All night long two gangs of cooks have
been at work, and there are fears and whispers that
with all their efforts, the breakfast will run short. Very
aggravating is it to wait for breakfast in this cold sea
air, with nothing else to think of, and your thoughts
quickened (if you are among the last) by the fear that
there is not enough to go round. A serious business,
too, it is to deal it out, requiring more than an hour of
hungry moments. The companies form in files, and
on each side of the ship approach the caboose. A mug
and plate are thrust through a hole. In a moment,
filled with a junk of pork, three “hard-tack,” and a pint
of pale coffee, they are thrust back. The hungry owner
seizes them and hurries away to some quiet spot, where
he can unclasp his knife and fork, and cool his coffee to
his liking. The long files of the unfed, one by one,
creep slowly up to the greasy dispensary. The first
company of the occasion ironically congratulates the
last, the last ironically condoles with the first. They
take turn about. Company A is first at breakfast to-day;
second at lunch; third at supper; to-morrow it
will be fourth, and thus it will keep on until at length
it reaches the agonizing state of being <i>last</i>!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Water!</span>—The water is the next annoyance of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>morning. The men are brought up on the upper deck.
On the lower one is a pump connected by a hose, with
the water casks below. The mate, on behalf of the ship,
and an officer, on behalf of the regiment, deal out the
water. Two men from every squad, each with a load
of canteens hung around his neck, come forward and
fill them from the tub—a slow and mussy piece of
work.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Inspection.</span>—“The water is dealt out, Colonel,” says
the Officer of the Day.  “Will you inspect the quarters?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The assembly beats, and the men again crowd the
upper deck. Armed with a lantern, I grasp a slippery
ladder, and go down into the dark,  “between decks.”
It is very still and almost empty there, much like a
gloomy cave. The companies have been divided into
four squads, and a sergeant and two corporals have
charge of the quarters of each.</p>

<p class='c011'>I begin with the first and poke the lantern up into
the upper tier, over into the middle tier, down into the
lower tier. Blankets out—knapsacks at the head—nothing
lying loose. No crumbs betraying hard-tack
smuggled in; the deck scrubbed clean. “Very good,
Sergeant. Your quarters do you credit.” The next, a
blanket not out—half a hard-tack in the upper tier, the
crumbs scattered over the lower—the deck dingy with
loathsome tobacco.  “Look at this, and this, and this,
Sergeant. Yours are the only dirty quarters in the
ship.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“Don’t you think the quarters pretty good on the
whole, Colonel?” asks the Officer of the Day.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very good, Captain. If we except that sergeant’s,
there is really nothing to find fault with.” And thus
ends the first inspection.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If the rebels hadn’t ha’ destroyed the light-house,”
remarks my friend the first mate, as he looks with his
glass toward Hampton Roads, “we could ha’ run right
straight in last night, but seeing that the ship is light
in ballast, and a good many souls aboard, why, it wasn’t
safe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So they destroyed the Cape Henry light, did
they?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes indeed, they did, and it does seem to me that
of all they’ve done that ought to ha’ set the hull civilized
world against them, it’s the worst. Just think now how
many a fine vessel must ha’ gone aground there, and
never be got off again, just for want of the light; why,
it does seem to me that it’s worse than a shooting
women and children; at any rate, it’s just the same.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There comes the pilot-boat, and she has her signal
set,” says some one.</p>

<p class='c011'>Far up the Chesapeake the pilot-boat is seen, a small
flag fluttering from her mast head. She comes straight
as an arrow, like a greyhound rushing down upon us in
his play. How beautifully she bounds along, looking as
she mounts the waves as if she would leap from the
water. The yards are backed and the ship stops and
waits for the little craft. The pilot-boat circles round
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>her, and coming into the wind, seems to settle down like
a dog resting from his sport. A little cockle shell of a
boat puts off, pulled by two black oarsmen, who buffet
and dodge the waves, and make their way slowly against
the wind toward the ship. There is much curiosity to
see this Virginian pilot, and all hands crowd forward as
he comes up the side. The Captain alone has not
moved to meet him. <i>He</i> stands dignifiedly on the poop
deck, his glass beneath his arm. The pilot does not ask
for him, or pause or look around; he evidently knows
the very spot on which the Captain stands. He bows
to the crowd around him, pushes his way through, and
mounts to the deck. He walks up to the Captain, and
they shake hands. The Captain hands him his glass:
the pilot takes it: it is the emblem of authority, and the
Captain no longer commands the ship.</p>

<p class='c011'>The pilot raises the glass and looks sharply in one
direction; he takes a turn or two up and down the deck,
and looks attentively in another. I am convinced that
he knows as well where we are as I should, were I standing
on the steps of the City Hall. All this looking is
evidently done to impress beholders with the difficulty
of being a pilot.  “How does she head?” says the pilot.
“Due west,” says the man at the wheel. “Keep her
west by sou’ half sou’,” says the pilot. “Wes’ by sou’
half sou’,” responds the man at the wheel.  “Set your
jib, sir,” says the pilot to the Capt.  “Set the jib,
Mr. Small,” says the Captain to the first mate.  “Set
the jib, Mr. Green,” says the first mate to the second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>mate. “All hands man the jib halyards,” says the
second mate.  “Aye, aye, sir,” respond the sailors, and
the soldiers look quite sober at finding themselves all of
a sudden in so difficult and maybe dangerous a channel.
Meanwhile the black oarsmen pull back to where the
pilot-boat still lies at rest. The touch of the cockle shell
upon her side startles her again into life. She shakes
her white wings, and turning, bounds off toward another
ship, whose sails are slowly rising from the waves far
off toward the east.</p>

<p class='c011'>What we have come to Fortress Monroe for no one
can tell. In spite of a decisive order to sail forthwith
for New Orleans, the wind refuses to blow. Another
weary week of calm and fog intervenes. The Captain
laments and growls, and says if we had kept on with
<i>that</i> breeze, we could have been at the Hole-in-the-wall,
and maybe at Abicum-light; but now there’s no telling
when the wind will set in from the west—he’s known it
set this way at this season for three weeks. The officers
and men repeat the growls and lamentations, and fail
not to ask me five hundred times a day what we have
come to Fortress Monroe for.</p>

<p class='c011'>The week of waiting ends, and a westerly wind assures
us that we may start.  “We must have a tug to tow us
down,” says the Captain.  “And we must have the
water-boat along side,” says the mate. A boat load of
officers and soldiers go ashore to make their last purchases.
I wait on the dock and watch the water-boat as
it puts off, and listen to the  “yo he yo”  on the  “Alice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Counce” and “Emily Sturges,” which tells me that
their anchors are coming up.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tug took us down—the pilot left us much as
before, and we are now out at sea. The “Emily” led
us by half an hour, and all day long was in sight, sailing
closer to the wind and standing closer on the coast.
As the evening closed in, we cast many jealous glances
toward her, and asked each other which ship would be
ahead in the morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>The second day was a gloomy, wintry day, with a
rising wind, and constantly increasing sea; and the
second night out I felt the motion grow and grow, but
thought it rather pleasant, and had no fears of evil consequences.
I rose with the reveille, which seemed
fainter than usual, steadied myself out of the cabin, and
still knew no fear. I reached the deck and found that
but four drummer boys rub-a-dubbed, and but few men
had come up from below. I mounted to the poop deck,
and there I found three lieutenants. There was something
unusual about them. Two sat very still braced
against a spar, while the third staggered violently up
and down with a pale, in fact a ghastly face, and kept
saying in a jolly manner to himself, “How are <i>you</i>,
ship? how are <i>you</i>, o—oh—shun?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is very strange,” thought I. “But perhaps
they’re ill. I’ll ask them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gentlemen, are you sick—sea-sick?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sick? oh no!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Nobody was sick, so I turned and looked down on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>main deck. The reveille had ended, yet the number on
deck had not increased. A sergeant with five or six
men in line was calling his roll in a loud voice, at which
he and half his men repeatedly laughed, as though
absence from roll-call was a capital joke.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is usual for an officer from each company to come
up to me immediately after the morning roll-call, and
report the state of his company, “all present or accounted
for,” or so many present and so many absent
and not accounted for. I am somewhat strict about
it, yet on this morning only one or two reported. I
thought this negligence strange—unaccountable—yet
for some reason or other, I did not go down and ascertain
the cause of it. I turned toward the east. The
sun was near his rising, and the crimson light filled the
sky and tinged the white foam of the tossing waves. It
was a splendid sight, and brought to mind one of the
finest sea pieces of the Dusseldorf. I stood watching
the wide expanse of heaving billows—the cloud-spotted
sky under-lit with rays of the coming sun—the unnumbered
waves breaking in long rolls of foam, silvered and
gilded by the glowing east. I was lost in admiration,
when I suddenly felt—sick! I made brave attempts to
keep myself up—to weather it out—to stay on my
legs—to stay on deck—to do something—to do anything.
In vain!</p>

<p class='c011'>That day the wind increased and blew a gale.
Through the long hours of the afternoon the vessel
plunged and tossed. Furniture broke loose and slid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>backward and forward across the cabin. The steward
looked in, seized the vagrant pieces, and lashed them
fast. Stragglers steadied themselves from door to table
and from table to sofa, to say that all the others were
down—that they began to feel a little qualmish, and
that affairs were growing serious. Toward midnight
there was a tremendous shock—the ship staggered and
stood still, as though she had struck upon a rock; in an
instant more the door of the forward cabin was burst
open with a crash, and in another the water broke
through the sky-light over my head, and poured, a torrent,
on the cabin floor. To the men between decks
it seemed a shipwreck. Yet there were not wanting
a few heartless wretches, who, neither sea-sick nor
frightened, made sport of all the others. “The ship’s
struck a breaker,” roared one of these from his bunk.
“All frightened men roll out and put on their boots to
sink in.” “Struck,” “breakers,” “sinking,” sounded
around, and several hundred men rolled out in the darkness,
and frantically tried to put on their boots. With
the next roll, away all hands went. Some caught at the
bunks—some clutched each other—the penitent prayed—the
wicked swore—the frightened blubbered—the sick
and philosophical lay still. In the midst of the sliding,
the scramble and the din, a voice rose from another
bunk, “Captains”—it thundered in the style of a Colonel
on drill—“rectify the alignment.” And the jokers
added to the din their loud laughs of derision.</p>

<p class='c011'>A little later the mate came in—a large, stalwart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>sailor, seeming a giant in his oilskins and sou’wester.
He carefully closed the door, stepped lightly across the
cabin floor, ceremoniously removed his hat, and looking
into the darkness of the captain’s state-room, said in the
most apologetic of tones, “Captain Singer, I’m really
afraid the mast will go, if we don’t ease her a point. It
works very bad, and the wind’s rising.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Captain considered slowly and said, “Ease her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The mate said politely, “Yes, sir,” and then backed
across the cabin lightly on tip toe, hat in hand, opened
the door slowly and noiselessly, and then, without replacing
his hat, slipped out into the storm.</p>

<p class='c011'>The long night wore away and was followed by a
longer day. The ship tossed and plunged, rising as
though she were mounting from the water to the sky,
and then sinking as though she would never stop. At
last the gale blew itself out, and then came a calm,
when the ship lay like a log on the water, rolling ceaselessly
from side to side, and creaked and groaned with
every toss and roll. But now there is a cry of land, and
the sick drag themselves to the deck and look toward a
rocky island of the Bahama group, which is the “land.”
How beautiful it seems, hung there on the horizon
between the shifting clouds and tossing sea! The breeze
is fair, the sea not rough, and we soon draw nearer to
this land. On the farther end rises the snowy tower of
the light-house, and beside it stands the house of the
keeper. No other house, nor field, nor tree, nor blade
of grass adorns this huge bare rock. The waves have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>worn grooves on the steep sides, and up these the water
dashes, and runs down in white moving columns.
Abreast of us is a strange opening in the wall-like
rock, which has given to the island its name of “Hole-in-the-wall.”
The spy-glasses disclose a man, a woman,
and some children, looking toward the ship. Once in
three months the supply ship will visit them, bringing
their food, their clothing, their water and the oil: once
or twice a year, when the sea is calm and the wind has
fallen, the keeper may row out to some ship to beg for
newspapers; more often they may gaze, as they are
gazing now, at passing vessels; and thus, with such
rare intervals, they pass their lonely life, cut off and
isolated from all mankind.</p>

<p class='c011'>The warm temperature and rich blue color of the
water tell us that we are in the Gulf Stream. As I lie
upon the deck looking upon the mysterious current, a
slender bird, eight or ten inches long, shining like silver,
flits through the air. “Did you see that bird?” asks
more than one voice. “Was it a bird?” “Yes, it flew
like one.” “No, it came out of the water and went
back there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s a flying-fish, gentlemen,” says the mate; “you’ll
see plenty of them soon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A more beautiful, fairy-like sight than these flying-fish
present, I have seldom seen. A delicate creature,
bright and silvery, and often beautifully tinged with
blue, emerges from the water, and soars just above the
waves in a long, graceful, bird-like flight, until striking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>against the summit of some wave that lifts its white cap
higher than the rest, it disappears.</p>

<p class='c011'>This is called a pleasant voyage from Hole-in-the-wall.
We watch the flying-fish, catch Portuguese
men-of-war, and bathe in the warm water of the stream,
until there appears before us what some at first thought
a mud bank, but which now proves to be another
ocean of muddy water.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is the Mississippi,” says the Captain. “The river
must be up, for we’re a hundred miles good from the
Sou’west Pass. There’ll be trouble in crossing the bar;
when the river’s up the water’s down.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As we draw nearer, the contrast between the two
oceans grows more plain. The line is as distinct as that
between land and water on a map. Now the bow of
the vessel reaches it—now the line is a midship—now I
look down upon it, and now the ship floats wholly in the
water of the Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c011'>The muddy sea has raised a ferment of excitement,
and many, who have all faith in the ship’s reckoning,
still look forward as though they could look through the
hundred miles before us, and see the wished-for land.
Night closes, however, leaving us surrounded by the
same muddy waves; but we turn in, with the strong
assurance that to-morrow we shall make the Pass.</p>

<p class='c011'>Land! But hidden under low fogs, that, I am told,
brood over this delta of the Mississippi. From the crosstrees
can be seen one or two steam-tugs, vessels at
anchor, and distant salt marshes; but from the deck we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>peer about in all directions, and see nothing in the fog.
A pilot moves the ship up to her anchorage. We are to
wait perhaps only the moving of the tugs—perhaps the
falling of the river; the river is up, and as was foretold
by the Captain, the water is down.</p>

<p class='c011'>The explanation of this paradox is simple. The water
on the bar is ocean water, though discolored by the
river. Its height is always a tidal height, that is, it
rises with the tide, not with the river. The freshets,
while they do not add to the height of the water,
nevertheless bring down large quantities of mud,
which settles on the bar, and thus builds up the
bottom without raising the surface of the water. The
pilots measure from the bottom, and finding it nearer
the surface than it was, say that the water has fallen,
when in fact it is the bottom that has risen. Then
come the tides and wash away the loose mud upon the
bar, and thus the water deepens while the river falls.</p>

<p class='c011'>We are again at anchor; a tug is heard in the fog,
and all turn anxiously toward it. The Captain of the
tug hails the Captain of the ship, and demands what
water she draws.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sixteen feet and a half,” is the answer. “Will
that do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Captain of the tug says it is doubtful—they are
going down to tug another ship that draws fifteen and a
half, and if they get her over, they will tug us at the
next flood-tide.</p>

<p class='c011'>That ship is the transport “William Woodbury.” She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>comes down gallantly, the soldiers crowding her bulwarks,
two powerful tugs puffing at her sides, and every
sail set. We watch her with anxiety. She passes a
buoy that we think marks the bar, and all seems well.
The mate says he “don’t know but akind of believes
she’s over.” As he speaks, she swings round, stops, and
sticks fast. The steam-tugs pull her backward and forward
and sidewise, and at last over the bar; she disappears
in the fog beyond, and we await with fresh
anxiety the flood-tide of the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c011'>These tugs have one strange appendage in the form
of a ladder as high as the smoke-pipe; on the top of
this is a chair, and in this chair is a man. It is the pilot
who thus looks over the low fogs of the Pass. From
this high place we hear the voice of one, toward evening,
and soon two tugs come down to try their strength in
dragging our ship through two feet of mud. The
heaviest hawser is out on deck and an end run over
either side to the stubborn little tug that lies there. The
anchor is tripped, a sail or two set, and with good headway,
we approach the bar. Suddenly every one who is
on his legs takes an unexpected step forward—the hawser
parts—the tugs break loose—and we are hard
aground. But the tugs do not give it up. They reattach
themselves and drag us, after many efforts, out
of the mud and back to where we started.</p>

<p class='c011'>We approach the bar again cautiously; but again we
feel the vessel grounding, and again she stands still.
The tugs tug away as though striving to drag us through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>by main strength, and many declare that we are moving
slowly. A neighboring buoy, however, stays close
beside us, and after half an hour’s hard work, shows
that we have not moved a foot. Still the tugs tug as
obstinately as ever. They drag us back and try afresh—now
to the right—now to the left—panting, puffing and
blowing. The pilots sit enveloped in clouds of black
coal smoke, and shout, and scream. At last, with the
last rays of daylight, and the last swelling of the tide,
and the last strands of the hawser, and at the moment
when all efforts must cease, we are dragged across the
bar, and enter the Mississippi.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>II.<br /> <span class='large'>THE PAY-MASTER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Westward from New Orleans stretches the Opelousas
railroad, and along this road we are now doing guard
duty. Guarding a railroad is the most unwelcome task
that can be thrust on the Colonel of a new regiment—scattering
the companies, demoralizing the men, destroying
the regiment, and therefore a Colonel, under such
circumstances, has a right to be a little discontented, and
very cross.</p>

<p class='c011'>I <i>am</i> a little discontented, and have wished a hundred
times that I were back, writing on the sunny hill-side of
Camp Lowe, enduring all the hardships of Tennessee.
From an unsoldierly point of view, there is nothing to
complain of here. For the leaky tent, the muddy floor,
the pork and “hard-tack” of the West, my large new
tent has a double-fly and plank floor; and it is filled
with tables, chairs, and other luxuries. Up the neighboring
bayou of La Fourche, too, come miniature canal-boats,
tugged along by little creole ponies, and laden
with fish and oysters, which the swarthy French fishermen
catch in the not distant Gulf. The surrounding
woods are filled with game that finds its way constantly
to camp, and from every one of the large plantations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>that abound here, are brought vegetables, eggs and
poultry. Yet I do not relish this ease and indolence—the
rough cavalry service suits me better, and I wish a
hundred times a day that I were back in Tennessee.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is the spring-time of the year, yet there is but little
of the reality of spring to us. The grass has long been
green, the flowers are plentiful, the sun is hot and burning,
but the leaves come leisurely along, and for a fortnight
have only moved. These flowers, too, have
generally no fragrance, though now and then there is
one that overpowers us with its sweet, sickening odor,
and the birds that fill the trees are songless, save the
“merry mocking-bird,” who, like the perfume giving
flowers, has more than his share of noise and song.
There is, therefore, none of the glad bursting forth that
makes so brief and beautiful our northern spring.</p>

<p class='c011'>This is a muster-day in the army, and it is the forerunner
of the Pay-Master. I have been busy since daybreak
calling the rolls of the companies along the railroad,
and I have now to ride twelve miles and muster
one that is doing Provost guard duty in the village of
Houma. It is not a pleasant ride to Houma; the road
runs along a bayou, as straight and stagnant as a canal.
Occasionally there comes a boat, freighted with a dozen
barrels of molasses or a few hogsheads of sugar, furrowing
its way through the green scum that covers the
water, and breaking down the rank-growing weeds that
choke the channel. The vagabond-looking ponies that
drag it along, travel on the “levee,” which has the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>appearance of a tow-path, and makes the bayou look
more than ever like a canal. This bayou is a hideous
frog-pond, long drawn out, filled with black, slimy mud,
and teeming with hideous reptiles. My horse starts as
I ride beside it, and snuffs the tainted air nervously, for
two turkey-buzzards fly up from the huge carcass of an
alligator, and alight close beside me on the fence. Two
more remain on the alligator, gorged so that they cannot
rise. Their rough, dirty feathers remind one of the
uncombed locks of a city scavenger. No one ever shoots
them, but draws back and says, with unconcealed disgust,
“What a foul bird that is.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet on the other side of the road, spreading back to
the poisonous swamps in the rear, lie some of the rich
plantations of Louisiana. There are the sugar-houses,
with their heavy brick chimneys, as large and clumsy as
those of a foundry; and near by stand the planter’s
house, the overseer’s house, the engineer’s house, and a
little village of contraband cabins. The vast fields are
cut up into square blocks by ditches, sometimes ten feet
deep, reminding one of the graded lots in the outskirts
of a city. On one side of each range of these blocks is a
raised plantation road, which crosses the ditches on substantial
bridges, and runs, perhaps for miles, arrow-like,
as a railroad. It is probable that the plantation is surrounded
by a levee, to keep the water out. The large
ditches then empty into a canal, and at the end of this
canal will be found a “pumping machine,” driven by a
steam engine, which pumps the plantation dry and keeps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>it above water. Such wealthful agriculture we have
nowhere in the North.</p>

<p class='c011'>The broad, dull thoroughfare on which I ride is an
unpleasant contrast to the shaded bridle-roads of Tennessee.
Yet it furnishes our only ride, and for twelve
miles there is but one turn-off, or intersecting road, and
not one hill or hollow. So far as the eye can reach in
all directions—so far as one can ride on any road he may
choose to take, is one weary, continuing, unbroken flatness.
I feel a constant longing to mount a hill, and
often have to repress an impulse to climb a tree, where
I can look around and breathe a little freer air.</p>

<p class='c011'>Houma looks somewhat like a deserted village. The
shops are shut, many of the houses empty, and the
scowling people wear an idle, listless air. There is no
love lost between them and the troops. Some months ago
a few sick soldiers of the twenty-first Indiana were massacred
not far from the village, and it was done by some
of the most “respectable” planters. I believe all of the
guilty parties escaped to the enemy’s lines, except one,
and he, poor wretch, lived for months in the gloomy
swamps near us, a frightened maniac. His body was
lately found, showing that he had lain down, worn out
and sick, and died alone in the dreary solitude.</p>

<p class='c011'>In one of these deserted houses I find my officers
established, and after finishing the muster of their company,
I spend with them a pleasant evening and quiet
night. Another dull and solitary ride carries me back
to my head-quarters, to await the wished-for coming of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>the Pay-Master. A regiment which has never been
paid looks eagerly for that admired and much respected
functionary. It understands not why there should be
delays, and coins a rumor at least once a day, that he is
on his way to camp. After many disappointments, one
of these rumors assumes a substantial shape. A special
train comes rushing up the railroad, consisting of an
engine and a single car. The train shrieks that it will
stop and does so: it bears only two passengers, and a
heavy, mysterious, iron-bound box. They are the Pay-Master,
his clerk, and his money chest.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Pay-Master is smiling, and happy as a man who
travels with a trunk full of smiles should be. He walks
through the excited throng to my tent, and the mysterious
box is borne by two soldiers in a reverent manner
behind him. He takes it from them at the tent in a
careless sort of way, and pulls and tumbles it about as
if it were a common piece of vulgar wood—he does not
even glance at it as he twists and turns the mysterious
lock. From its depths he brings out our pay-rolls, and
says in a complimentary manner that they are correct—that
indeed he never paid a new regiment where they
were more correct. He shakes his head despondingly,
and adds that there are some regiments in this department
that have never been paid—that have never got
their rolls right, and he fears never will. Our men are
immensely relieved as these facts are whispered around,
and acquire fresh confidence in their officers,—perhaps
rather more than they ever had before.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>The rolls are sent back to the different companies, and
the men assemble round each Captain’s tent and sign
them. The Pay-Master fortifies himself against the
coming excitement with a little luncheon. Meanwhile
a table has been placed at the opening of a tent, within
which are the mysterious box and clerk.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, Colonel,” says the Pay-Master, “if you will
be so good as to give the necessary orders, we will
begin.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Pay-Master takes his place behind the table
which bars the entrance to the tent and box; the
first company falls in “by one rank,” faces “without
doubling,” and in single file approaches the Pay-Master.
The Pay-Master takes a pay-roll and calls a name; the
clerk takes its “duplicate” and checks the name; the
owner steps forward and answers to the name. The
Pay-Master seizes a bundle of the precious paper and
tears off the wrapper. The notes dance through his flying
fingers, and flutter down before the owner of the first
name. The Pay-Master carelessly seizes them, says
“sixty-three dollars, forty-five cents,” and tosses them
toward the owner, as though he wishes to be rid of the
vulgar trash. The owner, much discomposed, carefully
picks them up and hurriedly retires to the nearest
bench, whereon he seats himself, and slowly counts and
recounts the notes, at least five times. It is labor in
vain; he cannot make them a dollar more, or a dime
less than did the Pay-Master. Those practised hands,
though they count the money only once, and move
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>with the swiftness of a magician’s wand, never make
mistakes.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is another day’s work before the Pay-Master,
and a somewhat unusual one for him. Four companies
remain to be paid, and the special train has gone back
to New Orleans. We must travel, therefore, by a hand-car.
The mysterious box is carried to the car, the clerk
sits on it, keeping a bright look-out toward the rear,
lest any pursuing locomotive should rush upon us ere we
know it; the Pay-Master and I seat ourselves in front
upon the floor, and half a dozen soldiers, who are both
guard and engine, stow themselves away as best they
can, and then seizing the crank, put our little vehicle
slowly in motion.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is very pleasant skimming along swiftly so close to
the ground, with so little noise or jarring, with such an
absence of smoke and dust, and with such a free, unrestrained
view of everything around us. By far the
pleasantest ride upon the rail that any of us have ever
had, is this. We fly quickly across the wide plantation
that adjoins the camp, and then enter the wood or
swamp, whichever you prefer to call it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There will be no train coming along I hope,” said
the Pay-Master, as he glanced at the narrow roadway
and black, slimy water that came close to us on either
side. “What should we do <i>now</i>, for instance?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tumble the hand-car into the swamp, and slide ourselves
down the sides of the road, and lie quiet till the
train has passed.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“Ugh!” said the Pay-Master. “I do not like the
idea of sliding myself into that water. Look how black
and slimy it is, and then that unhealthy green scum
upon it. I should not wonder if it were full of snakes
and alligators.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alligators! You may say that; look there!”</p>

<p class='c011'>An immense alligator is seen stretched on a fallen
tree, and dozing in the warmth of the April sun.</p>

<p class='c011'>“May I give him a shot?” asks the sergeant of our
guard, drawing his revolver.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, if you can hit him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The sergeant slowly raises his pistol—the hand-car
stops—bang! and the bullet strikes against the scaly
side and glances off. The alligator slides from the log,
and disappears in the inky water.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t care about making that gentleman’s acquaintance,”
says the Pay-Master. “Mr. Clerk, please keep
a sharp look-out behind for any stray locomotive that
may be coming along, and the Colonel and I will look
out ahead. Seven miles you say it is to the next station?
Well, I shall feel a little easier when we get there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The hand-car resumes its former speed, and we fly
along through the deep shades and deeper stillness of the
swamp. The rumbling of the car that we hardly heard
in the open fields now echoes distinctly, and our voices
almost startle us, they sound so very clear and loud.
There are no fields or openings on either side, no firm
ground to stand upon, and the trees rise out of the green-coated
water.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“Stop! what’s that? There’s something ahead,”
calls the Pay-Master; “is it an engine?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, sir,” replies the sergeant, “it is the picket at
Moccason bayou.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A mile or two ahead can be dimly seen something
moving where the railroad track is lost among the over-hanging
trees. Then, as the car lessens the distance, can
be distinguished the figures of three or four men, the
gleam of their muskets and the blue uniform of the
United States. The picket has turned out and is watching
us. Our engineer puts on a full head of steam, and
our little special train rushes along faster than ever,
until it is “braked-down” on the very bank of Moccason
bayou.</p>

<p class='c011'>“These are your men, are they?” asks the Pay-Master.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, they are here guarding the bridge.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I will take an order from them authorizing me
to pay the money to their Captain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Pay-Master writes the order, and looks around
with curiosity at the picket station. We peer into the
bayou, which is supposed to swarm with deadly moccason
snakes, and then climbing on the car, resume our
jaunt. We pay the two companies stationed at Tigerville;
we hearken to the commanding officer’s advice to
stay and dine with him, and then, with a new hand-car
and a fresh guard, we run twelve miles further up the
road and pay the last company. An hour or two after
dark this is accomplished, and we prepare to return.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>As we approach the car, one of the men meets us with
a rumor that a division of the army is coming up the
single track, and that doubtless we shall meet several
trains where the swamp is darkest and the roadway narrowest.
We investigate the rumor, and find that it is
based on the fact that the trains <i>ought</i> to come, but no
one really knows that they are coming. “What do you
think, Pay-Master? You and the money chest must be
taken great care of.” The Pay-Master thinks that if we
had a lantern it would be safe. We procure a lantern,
and hold a consultation. One of our guard is an experienced
railroad builder; he knows the ways of hand-cars,
and can tell afar off the sound of advancing trains.
He promises to “brake-down” the hand-car in an
instant, and to forewarn us of impending engines long
before they can run into us.</p>

<p class='c011'>We start, and the experienced man stands with his
hand upon the brake, and an officer who has joined us
takes his place in front, holding the lantern plainly in
sight. Away we go into the darkness of the swamp—a
darkness so thick that you cannot see the man who sits
beside you. For several miles the road runs straight as
an arrow, and I sit behind with the Pay-Master, trusting
those in front to keep a look-out. At length we come
out of the swamp and enter an open plantation country,
through which the road makes many turns. “Ease off
and then brake-down,” and the car lessens its speed and
in a few moments stops. The experienced man goes forward,
puts one ear close to the track, and announces
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>that there is no train on the road within ten miles. We
start again, and this time I stand up and post myself
where I can have a clear view of the front.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Colonel, sit down,” says the experienced man;
“no use in your standing up. I’ll tell you the moment
any train comes in sight.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m much obliged to you, but as the way is somewhat
crooked from here to Tigerville, I think I shall be
quite as comfortable keeping a little look-out of my own,
as sitting down and trusting it all to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The hand-car runs merrily forward; the men, refreshed
with our brief halt, are sending it along with increased
speed, when through the trees and bushes, across a sharp
curve of the road—a flash—a light, and the thunder of a
coming train. “An engine.” “The cars.” “Brake-down’ quick.”
“They’re at full speed.” “They’ll be
on us if you don’t hurry.” The experienced man tugs at
the brake, the others start up and frantically endeavor
to extricate their legs and arms (which everybody else
seems to be sitting upon), the hand-car runs on as if it
will never stop; the heavy engine glares on us with its
great, glowing eye, and comes rushing forward in unabated
haste. There is no time to waste in trifles; the
officer in front springs from the car and runs down the
road, waving the lantern with all his might; a couple
of soldiers tumble themselves off, and one adroitly falls
across the track, and lies there stunned; the experienced
man strains away on his brake; the Pay-Master and I
drop off behind, and seizing hold of the car, succeed in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>stopping it. The train seems but a few yards distant,
crashing and thundering, and shaking the very ground
we stand on. The Pay-Master, who has been the most
cautious of the party, is now the most cool and decided.
While two men push against each other and the experienced
man gives contradictory directions, the Pay-Master
seizes the car, capsizes it off the track, and hurls
it down the bank. The precious box and the stunned
soldier are dragged out of the way, and the train goes
roaring past. When all is over, we first berate the
experienced man roundly, then haul the car with much
trouble up the bank and on to the track, and then feel
our way cautiously down to Tigerville. There we refresh
ourselves with a cold supper, tell over the tale of our
escape, and abuse the engineer to our heart’s content for
not seeing our lantern, and stopping his train. The Pay-Master
announces his intention of writing the history of
the last twenty-four hours, and publishing it as the
“Adventures of a Pay-Master.” I am sorry to say he
does not keep this promise.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>III.<br /> <span class='large'>THE WILD TEXANS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Some weeks after the pay-day, I found myself stretched
upon a bed, in a little shanty, at Tigerville. I had
some hazy recollections of having moved my quarters to
Tigerville—of having left my tent one evening, after
dress-parade, for a ride—of having ridden to the hospital
and dismounted, with a dizzy head and aching frame—of
the surgeon telling me, that I was very ill and must
not go back—and then of horrible fever-visions.</p>

<p class='c011'>The long days travelled slowly, and the sultry nights
wore away wearily, but they rolled into weeks ere anything
was gained. Then I was carried to Brashear, and
placed in a house which had been the mansion of an old
Louisiana family. In front was a strip of lawn shaded
by large oaks moss-hung and spreading. Beneath them
the view opened on the waters of the Atchafalaya, which
here had widened into Berwick Bay, and beyond, on the
little village of Berwick. Around were the remains of
the finest garden of western Louisiana. There still lingered
thickets of the fig and orange, of lemon and banana;
and there still flowered oleanders, and catalpas,
and jasmin, with many other specimens of tropical
fruits and flowers. As I sat observing these remnants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>of other times, an old New York friend and his wife
came in. The lady looked around on the grass-grown
walks, broken and effaced; on the long rows of fruit
trees to which horses were picketed; on the rare flowerbeds
trampled out by droves of mules; on the smooth
grass-plots covered with heaps of rubbish.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have been here before,” I said, as I marked
the careful looks that travelled so closely over every part
of the sad, disordered scene.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have passed the most of my life here,” she replied.
“This is my mother’s house.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the story of another divided family. All of
her own relations were in the Confederate lines, and she
had remained with her husband to await the coming of
the Union army.</p>

<p class='c011'>The enemy were gathering above us on the Teche.
Those oath-taking patriots, whose sons were in the enemy’s
army and crops within our lines; who, heretofore,
had stood aloof and scowled sullenly at us when we
passed, now came into camp, and for once were communicative.
They asked us if we knew what was coming,
and hinted at Southern conscription, and the damage
the Wild Texans would do the growing crop. They
feared the rough riders from the prairies, and told many
tales of their lawless cruelty. There came in, too, refugees
and contrabands, all speaking of the enemy’s increasing
strength; of boats collecting for some night
attack, and of the reckless fierceness of those Wild
Texans. On the opposite side of the river, the Wild Texans
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>began to move in open day. They came down in little
scouting parties, hiding behind houses and bushes, but
constantly on the alert. We must have presented tempting
marks for a long-range Enfield, yet they never fired,
but flitted silently about, always observing us, yet never
responding to our many shots.</p>

<p class='c011'>I watched these indications of the gathering storm,
with the nervous irritability inseparable from convalescence.
But every slight exertion brought on a slight
relapse, and I was soon forced, so far as I could do so, to
abstract myself from these excitements, and try to gather
back my strength in time to be of service in the coming
trouble. To this end, I took up the contents of some
captured mails. There were a few of the ridiculous
letters, that once found their way freely into our newspapers,
with bad spelling, and false syntax, and bombastic
rhetoric, but the most of them were sad. More
woeful letters were never read than these Wild Texans
wrote. There were such mournful yearnings for home—for
peace—for those they had left behind, that, insensibly,
the mind changed from exultation into pity.
There was a slight compunction, too, in running the eye
over the secrets of our enemies; a more than reluctance
to look upon these hidden words, which love and duty
had written for loving eyes, and coldly appropriate them
as our own. There were tales of want and tales of love—tidings
of weddings and of deaths. Here was a letter
from a father in Port Hudson, to his “dear little daughters;”
and here one from a mother to her “own beloved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>son.” This is a family letter, written by the parents
and sisters, to their  “two dear boys,” who now are
watching us from the other shore. And this one is the
reverse, for it is addressed to  “father, mother, wife, and
sisters.” The rebel soldier has filled his “last sheet”
with sad forebodings, with few hopes, much love, and
many prayers. A widow’s letter tells me, that her only
child fell at Iuka; and a father’s, that his eldest son
died before Dalton.  “What wonder,” each letter asks,
“that I wish to die and be at rest?” Among so many,
of course a love-letter can be found, breathing a first
avowal. It is written to some village beauty, and hints
at rivals, and her sometime smiles and sometime frowns.
The village beauty is, I judge, a slight coquette, who
has led her lover along with little encouragements
and little rebuffs. His letter is written in a manly
strain, and tells her that he had hoped to gain an honorable
name, and come back to win her in an early peace.
But the peace has not come. He can bear this suspense
no longer. He begs her to deal frankly and truly with
him, and, if she loves him, <i>to answer this letter</i>. The
letter will never be answered! I laid it away, and
thought that I would send it, by some flag of truce, to
the unknown belle. But my papers were captured, and
this letter, on which so many hopes hung, was lost.</p>

<p class='c011'>The threatening trouble drew nearer. There were
frequent alarms—the cannon rung out their warnings
often during the night—the long rolls were beaten and
the troops assembled and stood on their arms.  One
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>night I awoke at the call of the cannon near my window,
and heard the men assembling and the ammunition
wagons rolling past. To one accustomed to act at such
times, such forced inaction is the severest of trials. I
watched from habit, expecting the rattling small arms of
an attack, but the night wore away in unusual silence.
The next morning I was told that all our troops save the
sick and a few on guard, had gone. The sick men
whispered each other that we were defenceless, and it
was well that we had the telegraph and railroad, and
could call our troops back in case of an attack from
across the river. A few hours passed and then the telegraph
suddenly ceased its ticking—the railroad was cut
and the enemy was between us and our forces at La
Fourche.</p>

<p class='c011'>No relief came, and after three days of suspense,
Brashear was carried by assault. Some of our sick men
formed a line and behaved well, but they were quickly
overpowered. The red flag of our hospital was not understood
by the assaulting party, and for a little while
it looked as if no quarter would be given by the Wild
Texans to our sick and wounded. I had risen and mounted
my horse after the attack commenced, and I now dismounted
at the hospital, and with Captain Noblet of
the 1st Indiana Artillery stood awaiting the result. The
Captain was full of wrath, and vowed that he would put
the two or three charges, still in his revolver, in places
where two or three of the murdering villains would feel
them. A wild-looking squad, with broad hats and jangling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>spurs, rushed, revolver in hand, upon the building.
In no very decided mood at the time, and acting chiefly
from the military habit of looking to some one in authority,
I asked sharply if there was an officer among
them. They stopped, looked, a trifle disconcerted, and
one answered that he was a sergeant.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is a hospital,” I said, authoritatively. “Sergeant,
put two men on guard at the door, and don’t
let any but the wounded pass in.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well then, Bill,” said the sergeant, “you and John
stand guard here. And now see you don’t let nobody
go in unless they be wounded.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was the first and last order I ever gave to a Confederate
soldier, and it is due to the sergeant to say that
he executed it promptly and well.</p>

<p class='c011'>About the same instant another squad rushed to a
side window and poked their rifles through the sash.
Dr. Willets, the surgeon of the 176th, at the moment was
operating on a wounded soldier. With professional coolness
he turned to the window, and in the decided manner
that one would speak to a crowd of small boys,
said—</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is a hospital; you mustn’t come here. Go away
from the window and get out of my light.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The rifles were withdrawn; the party looked at the
window a moment in a somewhat awe-struck manner,
and then saying to each other, “You mustn’t go there,”
they withdrew.</p>

<p class='c011'>The wounded of both sides were brought in, and our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>surgeons, with scrupulous impartiality, treated all alike.
From beside their operating table I was moved to an
upper room with Lieutenant Stevenson of the 176th. A
minnie ball had torn through the entire length of his
foot, leaving a frightful wound that threatened lockjaw
and amputation. On the next cot lay a wounded Confederate
named Lewis—a plain, simple-hearted man,
who, for the next week, proved a useful and trustworthy
friend. As we thus lay there, my regimental colors, by
some strange chance, were brought into the room. Our
conversation stopped—the sick and wounded raised
themselves from their cots, and all eyes were fastened
upon the inanimate flag as though it were a being of
intelligence and life. The Texan soldier first broke the
silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That,” he said, in a dreamy way—half to himself
and half to us—“that has been the proudest flag that
ever floated.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>And is still, sir</i>,” said my wounded lieutenant,
proudly.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Texan said nothing. I expected an outbreak, for
there had been no little defiance in the lieutenant’s reply,
but none came. Some old emotion had evidently
touched his heart and carried him back to earlier and
better days.</p>

<p class='c011'>As he turned away my color-sergeant whispered to me
a plan for destroying the colors, which, however, I did
not approve. He pleaded that he knew every thread of
that flag, and that it would almost kill him to see it
borne away by rebel hands. “No, Sergeant,” I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>obliged to reply, “we must keep our colors by fighting
for them, and not by a dirty trick.” The answer satisfied
neither the sergeant nor my fellow officers. Yet
before my own imprisonment was over, I had the great
happiness of learning that the undestroyed flag, honorably
recaptured, was restored to its regiment.</p>

<p class='c011'>An officer soon appeared charged with the duty of
paroling our men. His quiet and courteous manner said
plainly that he was a gentleman, and he introduced himself
as Captain Watt, of Gen. Mouton’s staff. The Captain
and I looked at each other as men do who think
they have met before. He then informed me that
formerly he had spent his summers at Saratoga and
Newport, and that he thought we must have known each
other there. For this slight reason—so slight that
many men would have made it a good excuse for dropping
an acquaintance, if any had existed—Captain Watt
called on me repeatedly, procured an order for my being
retained in the Brashear hospital, and for several months
carefully transmitted to me such letters as found their
way through the lines. His family had been one of the
wealthiest in New Orleans, and were now refugees in
Europe. He had entered the army under the belief that
it was a duty to his State, and on the capture of the city
had beheld the ruin of all who were dearest to him. Yet
he made no ill-timed allusions to this, and in our conversations
always selected pleasant topics and spoke kindly of
the hours he had spent and the acquaintances he had
made in the North.</p>

<p class='c011'>The chief Confederate surgeon (Dr. Hughes, of Victoria,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Texas,) next arrived, and assumed command at
the hospital. It caused at first but little change. Our
own surgeons continued in charge of our wounded—our
steward continued to dispense the stores, and the
stores continued to be forthcoming. The Confederate
surgeons were polite and kind, doing all they could to
make us comfortable, and expressing thanks for the
treatment previously bestowed on their own wounded.
Thus, in a few hours, our affairs had settled down in
their new channels; and we, with a strange, new feeling
of restriction upon us, set ourselves to wait for the bad
news, and fresh reverses likely to come. From our
window we could see the Confederate forces crossing the
river. They waited not for tardy quarter-masters or
proper transportation, but, in flat boats and dug-outs,
pressed steadily across. A little steamer dropped out
of one of the narrow bayous, and worked ceaselessly,
bringing over artillery.  Ere sunset, we estimated that
five thousand men and four batteries had crossed, and
were moving forward to break our communications on
the Mississippi, and compel us to raise the siege of Port
Hudson.</p>

<p class='c011'>From this early day, there was a strong resolve in
the minds of most of us, to be cheerful before the enemy,
and, whatever we felt, not to let them see us down-cast.
When the mind is really roused and in motion, a little
effort will turn it into almost any channel. We made
the effort, and succeeded. One individual who came in
last, and ventured to say, with solemn visage, that this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>calamity was awful, was immediately frowned down,
and warned that, if he talked such nonsense here, he
should be moved to some other ward. The effect was
magical, and in ten minutes he became rather a merry,
careless kind of fellow. This treatment, I believe, saved
many lives; and I found that my own convalescence,
which had been slow and changeful in the previous
quiet, was now rapid and steady.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were sorrows enough to see, if one chose to look
toward them. So many causes never united to depress,
and never produced so little effect. Neither the shameful
loss of the post, nor the presence of the sick and
wounded filling every room, nor our unburied dead who
lay around the building, nor the prospect of a long captivity,
nor the helplessness of disease, nor the suffering
of wounds, were sufficient to make us appear sad. I
marvelled then, and cannot understand now, how the
mind was able to throw off these troubles, and how <i>real</i>
this enforced cheerfulness became. A sense of duty dictated
it at the beginning, and redeemed it from heartlessness
afterward. Once, indeed, my spirits failed me,
as I searched some private letters to find an address.
They were so light-hearted and happy, and dwelt on the
belief, as on a certainty, that he, to whom they were
written, would return crowned with honor. It was a
happy and brief illusion. An only sister had given
her only brother to the war—the orphan pair had made
this great sacrifice of separation; and now I had to write
to the young girl, and say that he had been my most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>trusted officer, and had fallen for the honor of his
flag.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>There was a class of captives who saw the loss of
Brashear with heavier hearts than those who possessed
the rights and hopes of “prisoners of war.” The
unhappy contrabands were agitated before the blow fell,
but met it with the tearless apathy of their race. “The
niggers don’t look as if they wanted to see us,” I heard
one Confederate soldier say to another.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” said the other; “but you’ll see a herd of fat
planters here to-morrow after them. <i>They</i> don’t fight
any, but they are always on hand for their niggers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was even so: for days, planter after planter appeared,
and party after party of men, women and children,
laden with their beds and baggage, tramped sorrowfully
past our quarters. The hundreds that remained went, I
know not whither.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was one woman, a quadroon, who had been an
attendant in our hospital. With her there were an old
mother, darker than herself, and a little daughter so
fair, that no one ever suspected her of being tainted
with the blood of the hapless race. This woman, through
all the turmoil and trial of that time, never lost the
little marks of neatness and propriety that tell so plainly
in woman of innate dignity and refinement. The tasteful
simplicity of her frequently changed dress; the neat
collar and snowy cuffs; the pretty work-box, and more
especially her quiet reserve, indicated rather the lady
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>than the slave. During the fight she had been calm
and brave, and when a couple of cowards had rushed
into the hospital and begged for a place where they
could lie down and hide themselves, this <i>woman</i>, while
volleys were firing at the hospital, and men and women
falling in the passages, had shown these <i>men</i> to a room
and closed the door on them, and walked away so
quietly that one might have thought her beyond the
reach of the danger that threatened them. An hour or
two later, as she passed through the ward where we
lay, she stopped at the window and looked out on the
scene of the Confederates crossing the river. Of all the
persons to whom the capture of Brashear boded grief and
wrong, there probably was not one to whom it threatened
so much as to her. With her mother and her
child, she had been preparing to seek the surer refuge
of the North, and this direful calamity had come when
the place of safety appeared almost within her reach.
Yet she shed no tears, and uttered no complainings.
Her large, sad eyes fastened on the river, she stood
beside the window and heard the shouts and yells that
told of the Confederate triumph. For half an hour she
never moved; her face retained its soft composure,
and only once the muscles of the lip fluttered and
trembled, as though there might be a troubled sea within.
Then she turned and went back to her work, as
calmly as if she alone had suffered no change. She
cheered those men who were struggling for strength to
go out on parole; she worked for those officers who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>were to be sent forward into captivity. For herself, she
never invited aid or sympathy. We asked her if we
might not send for her former master to come and take
her back to her old home. But this, for some untold
reason, she steadfastly refused. It was urged that she
and her child would be sent far into Texas or Arkansas;
and that they might be seized, as so much booty, by
some of these half-savage strangers. She answered
quietly, that she had thought of this. Ere we parted,
we asked her what future help we could give, and
what plan she would pursue to regain her freedom,
or secure some less dangerous home. And she said
briefly, that she did not know, and said no more.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. Captain John S. Cutter.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The captured officers, able to march, were sent forward
to Shreveport, and the men were paroled and marched
off to our lines. Three officers of my regiment remained
with me—two sick, and one severely wounded.
Two “citizen prisoners” were also added to our number.
One of these, whom I shall call Mr. Stratford, was held
as lessee of a confiscated plantation. His wife was permitted
to remain with him, and she now visited the hospital
daily. The other civilian was Mr. Dwight Parce,
of Chenango County, New York, who had just begun
business in Brashear. He now witnessed the destruction
of his property with undiminished cheerfulness, and,
although an invalid, fated to fill a prisoner’s grave in
Texas, met the discomforts that awaited him with a
serenity and hopefulness that nothing ever disturbed.</p>

<p class='c011'>We all effected some captures of baggage. Captain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Watt sent me an order for the delivery of mine if it
could be found, and Dr. Hughes, with ever ready kindness,
advised me to take his ambulance and search for it
at the fort, where some captured property was stored.
The guard consisted of a young gentleman in his shirt-sleeves and no shoes, who, when requested to go,
whistled violently, and perched himself on the rear
of the ambulance, with his face toward the hospital and
his back toward me. I asked him, with some surprise,
if he was not going to take his rifle; at which he stopped
whistling and said, he reckoned not. After whistling
a few minutes, he further defined his position by
saying, that if I ran away he reckoned he could run
after me; and then, that he reckoned the climate had
been a heap too much for me. After another whistle
his stiffness wore away a trifle, and he manifestly tried
to put me at my ease by saying, “Dog gone the
Lousanny climate, and the bayous, and the beef, and
dog gone the Lousanyans: they’re the meanest set of
people ever I see. I’d just as soon shoot one of ’em as a
Yank.” This put me quite at my ease, and we then had
a very interesting conversation. The etymology of
“dog gone” my guard was ignorant of; he suggested
that it meant pretty much what something else did, but
wasn’t quite so bad, in which opinion I coincided.
Since then I have learnt that this expressive phrase is
derived from the threat of putting a <i>dog on</i> you, and
that it saves annually, in Texas, an immense amount of
swearing, and is found to answer just as well.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>On the morning of the third of July, the Officer of the
Day appeared. He was a Captain in Colonel Bates’ Texan
Battalion, and he blandly begged that we would
prepare to move in the afternoon; the boat would be
ready at five, and we would be sent to the hospital at
Franklin, where we would be much more comfortable.
The boat did not come, however, and we remained to
celebrate the “Fourth” at Brashear. We went round
among our sick men who remained, to cheer them with
the certainty of their early release; we read the Declaration,
and we drank a bottle of wine, which Mrs. Stratford,
with patriotic devotion, smuggled in for us. Our
friend, the ex-officer of the day, re-appeared to apologize;
the boat had been detained—he knew he must have
caused us much trouble—he had come to beg us to forgive
him—he deeply regretted that he had not known of
the delay in time to inform us. To-day he believed
that there would be no delay, and he had just requested
the new Officer to order the boat up to the hospital,
so that we should not have the trouble of walking
down to where she lay. Nothing could have been more
elegant, chivalric, and delightful. If he were one of my
own officers and I were the Lieutenant-General, he could
not have been more courteous and respectful.</p>

<p class='c011'>We started on our “Fourth of July excursion” in the
afternoon. While the boat was lying at the wharf, an
officer, with long white hair and of imposing appearance,
came slowly down the saloon. As he drew near
I observed a Colonel’s insignia on his collar, and one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>the guard whispered me, that it was Colonel Bates, the
commanding officer at Brashear. The Colonel marched
up to me, extended his hand, and with grand solemnity,
in keeping with his dignified bearing, said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Colonel, I have come down now to apologize for not
having waited upon you before. I ought to have done
so, sir—I ought to have done so. But I have been over-occupied.
I pray you to excuse me, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When I consider our difference in years, and the different
circumstances that surrounded each, I do not know
of any incident that could have pleased me more than
this stately courtesy of the old Colonel. An interesting
conversation followed, in which I learnt that he was an
Alabamian by birth. He spoke highly of the Texan
character, which, he said, excelled in bravery and simplicity;
but he warned me that the country could furnish
few comforts, such, he said, as Northerners have at home.
Then, when the boat was ready to start, he called up the
officer of the guard, and said to him:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Captain, your orders are strict, I know; but these
gentlemen are invalids; they are too weak to escape,
sir. You must construe your orders liberally, sir, in
favor of the sick. Do not let the guard trouble these
gentlemen, and make them as comfortable as you can.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was another Colonel who succeeded Colonel
Bates, at Brashear; he was a citizen of a New England
State, and had been an ice merchant in New Orleans.
When the war came, he went, not “with his State” but
with his property. All the indignities, ill-treatment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>meanness and cruelty that we met with at Brashear and
Franklin, came directly from him. While the <i>real</i>
Southern officers were showing us unsought kindness
and attention—while they were overlooking what they
sincerely believed to be the needless ruin of their homes,
and the wanton destruction of their property, this miserable
Northern renegade was bullying Northern ladies—“bucking
and gagging” unfortunate prisoners, and
sending sick and wounded officers out of the hospital by
orders as cowardly as they were cruel.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Franklin Hospital had been the “Franklin House”
before the war, and stood close beside the bayou. Lieutenant
Stevenson was placed in the wounded ward, and
the rest of us were assigned three pleasant rooms in
a wing of the building. Our guard consisted of a corporal,
named Ingram, and six men of Colonel Bates’
regiment. They bivouacked on the piazza, and completed
our confusion as to what Wild Texans are. They
did not drink; they did not swear; they did not gamble.
They were watchful of us, but did everything
kindly and with a willingness that greatly lessened our
feeling of dependence.</p>

<p class='c011'>The surgeon in charge of the hospital, Dr. Marten,
was polite and kind. A stylish little French lieutenant
of the 10th Louisiana, named Solomon, was assiduous in
his attentions. He detailed a contraband as our especial
servant; hourly sent us little presents, in the way of
fruit and refreshments, and paid us those easy, chatty
visits, that Frenchmen pay so much better than any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>other men. There was a sort of Dutch Major-Domo,
one Schneider, who took us under his special protection,
blowing up the cook and scolding the waiter, on our behalf,
a dozen times a day. There was also a sergeant of
the Crescent regiment—a soldier and disciplinarian, but
easy and communicative toward us. Lastly, there was
our contraband, bearing the name of Ben, and very
sharp and shrewd was he, and never wanting in good humor
or flourishing obeisances.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ladies of Franklin flocked to the hospital, bringing
fruit and flowers, and knick-knacks of their own preparing.
They differed considerably with the doctors on
questions of diet; and did about as much damage, in
their pretty way, as patriotic young ladies have done in
other than Confederate hospitals. They carefully avoided
the cot of the solitary Yankee prisoner in the wounded
ward; the well-bred passing it by as though the slight
were casual, and the ill-bred, showing with studied care,
that it was intentional. The Wild Texans who had captured
us shared not in these patriotic manifestations.
They, on the contrary, divided with Lieutenant Stevenson
whatever they received, looked after him as though
he were a brother soldier, and, once or twice, asked their
fair visitors rather angrily, why they didn’t give this or
that to that gentleman on the fourth cot. Yet it must
not be supposed that this conduct of the Franklin fair
proceeded entirely from their own wicked imaginings.
The women, like the men of the South, are all slaves of
public opinion. After awhile one lady, giving way to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>the natural kindness of her nature, stopped at the
prisoner’s cot, and then the others followed the example.
The presents flowed in with a free hand, and the sails
once fairly round on this tack, the wind seemed to blow
as strongly from the chivalric quarter as it had previously
blown from the patriotic.</p>

<p class='c011'>This narrative would not be truthful if I omitted
therefrom a statement of the fare, during our fortnight in
the Franklin hospital. It was so much better than I had
expected; so much better than I had supposed it possible
that prisoners could receive at rebel hands; so different
from the fare which we knew was to follow, that I
carefully noted down the bill on several days, and from
these select a favorable specimen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Wednesday, July 15.</i> <span class='sc'>At Sunrise.</span>—French Coffee
and Biscuits.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Breakfast.</span>—Beef Steak, Beef Stew, Cucumbers,
Stewed Peaches, Melons, French Bread, Biscuits, Toast
and Tea.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Dinner.</span>—Soup, Roast Beef, Beef <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">a la mode</span></i>, Cucumbers,
Egg Plant, Lima Beans, French Bread, Biscuits,
Tea.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This easy prison-life, however, received a jog, in the
shape of an officer of Speight’s Battalion of Texas Cavalry.
He was introduced to us as Lieutenant Geo. C.
Duncan, and he bore orders to carry us to Niblett’s
Bluff, on the Sabine. It appeared therefrom that we
were to be moved to the southern side of Texas, and not
to follow the officers captured with us.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>The orders were, to carry <i>all</i> the prisoners at the hospital
to Niblett’s Bluff; but when the officer saw Lieutenant
Stevenson, and heard the surgeon’s statement, he
sent down a special report from the surgeon, and waited
for further orders. In the meanwhile, our polite French
friend, Lieutenant Solomon, drove Mrs. Stratford to
New Iberia, and we awaited, with some anxiety, our
departure, and discussed the probabilities of marching
through, or giving out by the way.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>IV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE MARCH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It was Sunday morning, about sunrise, when Lieutenant
Duncan appeared at the door, and informed us that
we must start immediately. There was an instantaneous
springing up—a hurried toilet—a rapid rolling of blankets,
and a hastily-snatched breakfast of bread and coffee.
I remarked, with more unconcern in my manner than I
really felt, that I supposed Lieutenant Stevenson would
remain. The lieutenant’s countenance fell, and, looking
another way, he said, nervously, “Orders have come
to move <i>all</i> immediately, and I have no alternative.”
It was my unpleasant task, therefore, to go down and
announce to the wounded officer that he must go. In
addition to his painful wound, he was suffering from an
attack of fever. His exhausted appearance frightened
me, though I talked quite boldly of the good effects
of change of air, and the advantages of continuing
with us.</p>

<p class='c011'>A clumsy plantation wagon rumbled to the door, and
the new guard, mounted on wild-looking Texan horses,
drew up around it. The old guard, like good fellows,
helped us quite cordially in carrying out our baggage;
and they shook hands and bade us good bye, with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>warmth that savored much less of rebel enemies than of
countrymen and friends. Some newly arrived prisoners
were brought from the Court House, and we started.
As we moved off, one of them seized me by the hand
with many expressions of surprise. At first I did not
recognize him, but, after a moment, discovered that he
was Captain Frederick Van Tine, of my former regiment,
and learnt that he, with two Massachusetts officers,
was captured on the Mississippi, and, for the last week,
had been confined in the jail at Thiboudeau.</p>

<p class='c011'>Up the main street of Franklin we marched two by two,
the guard strung along on each side, their rifles unslung
and their eyes watching us, as if they somewhat feared
an immediate escape. The loafers of Franklin of course
turned out to stare at us, and made remarks rarely complimentary;
the women looked at us from the door-steps
as we passed, some triumphantly, and a few in pity.
At the head of this inglorious procession it was my place
to walk; but the new prisoners revealed the hitherto
concealed news, and I felt proud and happy over the long
delayed result of Vicksburg and Port Hudson.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beside our own party, and the three officers from the
Mississippi, were a number of “citizen prisoners,” and
an unfortunate deserter whom they had caught at
Brashear. Of these civilians, a dozen were Irishmen
and they immediately placed themselves at the head of
the column, and proceeded to walk and talk with a zeal
that nobody attempted to equal. A move is always animating,
even when it is toward captivity; but our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>excitement was short-lived. Hardly had we passed
from the shadow of the town, when the convalescents
felt the effect of the burning, fever-kindling sun. It
was a serious business for some of us. One hundred
and eighty miles distant flowed the Sabine, and we were
to march there, over open prairies and in the middle
of the Southern summer.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before a mile was travelled over, I could see the effect
of the fearful heat in others, and feel it on myself.
Faces grew flushed; coats were stripped off, and the
perspiration poured in streams. Yet it was a matter of
honor not to give up. For my own part, I was smarting
with mortification at the disgrace of Brashear, and
resolved, and re-resolved, to walk till I fell dead, before
one of these Southern soldiers should say that a Yankee
Colonel had given out.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the head of the guard rode a good-looking young
fellow, tall and sinewy, and with the merriest face I
have ever seen in a Southerner. I had some doubts, at
first, whether he was a private or a Captain, but found
that he was a corporal. He was mounted on a compact
little bay, called, in Texas, a pony; a long revolver was
stuck in his belt; a lariat rope loosely coiled hung on
the saddle-bow; his bright Springfield rifle was balanced
across the pommel, and with his broad hat and heavy,
jangling Spanish spurs, he formed a brilliant picture of
a Wild Texan. As some little changes and arrangements
were wanting and the lieutenant was not in sight,
I addressed myself to the corporal, and asked if he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>would order a halt for a moment. “Why to be sure I
will,” was his very ready reply, followed up with the
order, “Now, halt here, men, and let these prisoners
put their little tricks on the wagon; there is no need of
their packing them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We took advantage of the halt to lash some sticks to
the sides of the wagon and to spread upon them our
blankets, so as to form an awning over Lieutenant Stevenson.
But the sun beat down hotter and hotter. At
the next halt, one of us took a canteen from the end of
the wagon—the water was hot, so incredibly hot that
the others were called up to feel it, and all agreed that
its heat was painful. My first impression was, that this
intense burning heat would blister us. But the damp
Louisiana atmosphere caused floods of perspiration,
pouring over the exposed face and hands, and soaking
quickly through every garment. Faces grew more and
more flushed; conversation flagged and soon ceased.
Those who, at the beginning, rattled away cheerfully,
walked in moody silence near each other, occasionally
exchanging distressed looks, but rarely, if ever, speaking
a word.”</p>

<p class='c011'>About mid-day the expected shower of the rainy season
came down on us furiously. We drew up under
some trees, and stood close against the leeward side of
their trunks, until it blew over. The different characteristics
of the three parties who were gathered there
immediately developed. The Irishmen laughed, hullabaloed,
pushed each other out in the rain, and treated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>the affair as a capital joke. The Northerners shifted
their positions, and attempted improvements, while the
rain was at the worst—grumbled a great deal, and
hurled fierce denunciations at, what they called, their
“luck.” The Southerners silently unrolled their blankets,
folded them around their shoulders, looked upward
at the storm with their usual sad indifference of expression,
made no attempts to better their condition, and
waited apathetically till it was over.</p>

<p class='c011'>A prairie spread out for several miles immediately
beyond our sheltering trees, and the road curved around
its outskirts. It was a prairie, but a tame one; interspersed
with fields; pastured by cattle; surrounded by
houses, and looking like any dull, uninteresting plain.
Its grass, however, was thick and wet, and its sticky
black mud soon loaded our boots and almost glued us
fast. The coolness of the air quickly vanished, and the
sun, more burning than ever, re-appeared. We dragged
on wearily, very wearily, casting wistful glances at the
grove on the other side, which rose very slowly, and, for
a long time, seemed as distant as when we started. At
last, however, we manifestly drew nearer; the chimneys
of a house could be distinguished in the foliage, and the
guard cheered us with the assurance that it was the
house at which we were to halt. Every one made a
last effort, and after half an hour’s exertion, we dragged
ourselves out of the muddy prairie and into a plantation
yard, bordering on the Teche.</p>

<p class='c011'>We sat there waiting for the wagon, and watching a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>small drove of hogs that had come down the bank of
the bayou, and, half immersed, were greedily eating the
green scum that covered the water. The lieutenant had
bought provisions at the house, and hired the contrabands
to cook for us. The dinner finally appeared, consisting
of a large kettle of boiled beef, and a quantity of
corn bread in the shape of little rolls. It did not impress
us favorably; but the guard seemed to think it excellent—perhaps
because <i>boiled</i> beef was a rarity—perhaps
because the corn bread was a superior article, (I was not
a judge of it then); and one, with charming simplicity,
said, “If we do as well as <i>this</i>, it <i>will</i> do!” To
which rhapsody one of my disgusted friends was obliged
to respond, with a faint and sickly smile, “Yes, yes; it
is very nice.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The place of bivouac that night was in the grass-covered
yard, or rather field, of one of the finest plantations
on the Teche. The owner soon appeared, accompanied
by his son, his son-in-law, and a friend. He was an old
gentleman, dressed with the scrupulous taste and neatness
of a Frenchman, and treated us with as much
politeness and as little kindness as could very well be
united. The son-in-law regaled us with a description of
the manner in which some of our troops had plundered
his house, and burnt his furniture; and the friend sat
himself down, and opened with the invariable remark,
“We consider this a <i>most</i> unnatural war, sir;” which
he followed up with the invariable question, “When do
you think there will be peace, sir?” To these I gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>my invariable replies, that we also thought it a most unnatural
war, and that there would be peace whenever
the Southern soldiers chose to go home and take care of
their own affairs. The gentleman seemed very much
disgusted at the idea of having peace on such simple and
easy terms, and said solemnly, that he couldn’t allow
himself to believe it.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a large open shed beside us, but the ground
was covered with fleas, and we preferred the wet grass
and heavy dew of a Louisiana night, to these pests of a
tropical climate. But few slept well. For a long time
I felt too tired to close my eyes, and awoke repeatedly,
aching in every part. When daylight dawned we rose
so stiff and sore that we could hardly move, and with
renewed apprehensions made ready for another day.
Lieutenant Stevenson showed such increased exhaustion
that the Confederate officer took me aside and said, that
he would not be guilty of carrying him beyond New
Iberia.</p>

<p class='c011'>We started, not at daylight, as was intended, but a
long time after the sun was up. With all such parties
there are many petty causes of delay, and it requires an
iron-handed commander to bear them down, and carry
his party off at the appointed hour. Lieutenant Duncan
was too good-natured for this, and instead of coercing us,
he, on the contrary, told us to choose our own time, and
not to start till we were ready. The delay brought
down the burning sun again upon us, and the pain and
weariness of this second day much exceeded those of the
first.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>As we thus toiled along, the road, which was running
between un-inclosed fields, approached a tall rail
fence. Three or four of us were walking a few yards in
advance of the guard, when we heard the corporal shout
from behind, “Take care of the bull! Take care of the
bull!” I looked ahead and saw nothing very alarming:
a large red bull was drawing himself up, and lashing his
sides with his tail. After a moment or two, however,
he started toward us, shaking his head and breaking
into a low, deep bellow. He was a magnificent animal,
with long, low, spreading horns, and moved in a full,
square trot that many a horse might envy. There was
a scramble at once for the fence which stood very nearly
midway between us and the bull. What the result
might have been I think somewhat doubtful, had not the
gallant corporal, on his bright little bay, rushed past us
on a gallop. The pony was a herding pony and understood
his business. Like a spirited dog, he flew straight
at the bull until they nearly touched, then wheeling he
kept alongside, watching him closely and sheering off
whenever the long horns made a lunge toward himself.
The pony did this of his own accord, for, as he wheeled,
his rider held the rifle in his left hand and was drawing
the long revolver with his right, and these Texan horses
are rarely taught to wheel from the pressure of the leg.
A finer picture of intelligent instinct than this pony presented
could hardly be painted: his ears erect, his eyes
flashing, and his whole soul in the chase. The corporal
was not slower than his horse. He brought the long revolver
up; a shot flashed, and the poor beast received a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>heavy wound. This diverted his attention from us, for,
with a loud bellow, he wheeled toward the corporal.
But the pony’s eye was on him, and, quicker than spur
or rein could make him, he also wheeled, and scoured off,
across the plain faster than any bull could go. The corporal
brought up the rifle, and there was a second flash—a
second wound, for the bull staggered, and then
walked slowly and proudly away. Occasionally he
stopped, turned defiantly round, uttered deep bellowings,
and shook at us his splendid horns.</p>

<p class='c011'>The incident afforded us a little excitement, and led
me into a conversation with the corporal, who narrated
anecdotes of the wonderful intelligence of herding
ponies. The heat, the dust, the glaring sun, and increasing
pain and weariness at length stopped even a conversation
on so interesting a topic as horses are and ever
will be, and I was fain to drag myself along without
expending an ounce of strength on any object beyond
the dusty road. We entered upon the last two miles,
and saw Iberia in the distance. The road ran between
hedges twenty feet high—it was filled with a long
column of dust—not a breath of outer air disturbed it,
and the sun shone directly down from his noon-day
height. I felt myself grow weaker and weaker as we
advanced through this green boiler. The perspiration
poured into my eyes and blinded me—my head whirled
round—my feet stumbled and dragged, so that every
step seemed almost the last. While in this critical state, a
couple of pretty Louisiana “young ladies” stopped their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>carriage, and greatly refreshed me by expressing the
hope that we should be hung at the end of the lane, and
the opinion that hanging was quite as good treatment
as nigger-thieves deserved. Such was the power of this
well-timed stimulus, that I kept on for more than a mile,
and at last found that I was in the midst of the little
town of New Iberia.</p>

<p class='c011'>We halted in the shade of some large trees. There
seemed to be an unusual number of vagabonds in New
Iberia, who congregated closely round us, and asked
impudent questions (generally as to how we liked the
war <i>now</i>), until it occurred to our guards that this might
be annoying to us, and then they very promptly drove
the Iberian loafers back. One cowardly-looking, black-eyed
little rascal, however, was very desirous of finding
an officer of the Twenty-first Indiana amongst us that
he might kill him, and repeatedly hinted that he had a
great mind to kill one of us anyhow. But one of the
guard quieted him by the suggestion that if he wanted
to kill a Yank, he’d find plenty of them over on the
Mississippi, and that he’d better go there instead of
skulking round in the rear—anyhow, he’d better stop
insulting prisoners, or he’d have a right smart chance to
kill a <i>Texan</i>—dog-goned if he wouldn’t.</p>

<p class='c011'>Soon after this, an officer of the Provost Guard
appeared. The roll of the “citizen prisoners” was called
over, and all but six marched off to the jail. We were
put in motion, and marched to the outskirts of the town,
where we halted beside a saw-mill standing on the bank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>of the Teche. The lieutenant then brought a surgeon,
who speedily pronounced in favor of receiving Lieutenant
Stevenson, and directed that he should be taken at once
to his hospital.</p>

<p class='c011'>During the afternoon, our kind and courteous French
friend, Lieutenant Solomon, appeared, to take us to the
hospital, and thence to his own house. I asked Lieutenant
Duncan for a guard, and he politely sent one of
his men with us. One of my officers walked with me to
the hospital. It was in a church, and at its extreme end
we found Lieutenant Stevenson. He looked wretched,
and my hopes sank as I saw him. The church was
crowded with Confederate sick, and he was the only
prisoner there. Yet there was no alternative. We
knew that if he were carried along, a sadder parting
would soon ensue. Faintly hoping that we should
again see him, and inwardly praying that he might find
the friends he sorely needed, we bade him farewell.</p>

<p class='c011'>The French lieutenant rejoined us in the street, and
led the way to his own house. He wished, he said, to
present us to Madame, and offer us some slight refreshment,
which was not good, but was better than we
might enjoy again. We soon reached his house, and
were presented to Madame, who received us with the
grace and politeness of a French lady. The slight
refreshment, doubtless, was preparing, and we were
comfortably waiting to enjoy it, when a patriot soldier
of the Confederacy, with the villainous look peculiar to
those of Louisiana, stuck his gun and then his head in
the room, and said sulkily, that the Provost Marshal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>wanted us. Our worthy lieutenant accompanied us,
saying, “Oh, surely it must be a mistake; somebody
has told him you are making an escape. He will let
you return to my house, and you shall stay all the afternoon.”
Arrived at the Provost Marshal’s, the Louisiana
patriot left us on the sidewalk, and stepped in to inform
the august official that we were in waiting. That magnate
immediately came forth—a youthful, swarthy,
small-sized, unwashed Louisianian, with a consequential
air, and a vagabond face. “Take these fellows back to
your camp,” he said, addressing our Texan guard. “I
won’t have prisoners running about my town.” As he
said this, he honored us with a vicious stare, and then
banged back into his office.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no resisting this eloquence, so back we
went. Our guard, who had been very silent, became
very talkative. He swore pardonable oaths at the
Louisianians in general, and the Provost Marshal in
particular. As to the former, he said they were all a
disgrace to the South; and as to the latter, that if ever
he got a chance, he’d scalp <i>him</i>—dog-gone if he wouldn’t.
In camp, his excitement extended to the rest. Our gallant
friend, the corporal, was especially indignant.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What,” he said, “he spoke so right before you,
without your having insulted him. The dog-gone little
puppy. If I’d been there, I’d have slapped his face, and
then run for Texas. There’s just such ducks everywhere,
and most of all in Louisiana. Dog-gone them—I’d like
to shoot the whole of them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Our wounded honor being soothed by these chivalric
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>sentiments, and a shower of rain coming up about the
same time, we retired to the saw-mill, where we selected
soft planks, swept away the saw-dust, and made ready
for the night. About dark, Lieutenant Duncan returned,
with anger and mortification glowing in his face. He
had not been able to get fresh mules or a good wagon,
or full rations, or even a wagon cover, <i>for prisoners</i>, and
he was vexed and wrathful at the refusals he had met.
“I tell you what it is, though, gentlemen,” he said,
“you shall be taken care of, and have the best this
country can give you, if I take it out of their houses
with my revolver. It’s not so in Texas, gentlemen.
There our people haven’t got much, but they will give
you what they have.” In fact, the good lieutenant
was so chagrined and mortified, that I had to assure him
that we were not children, and would rather undergo a
little extra hardship, than put him to further trouble.
But while affairs were gliding in this harmonious and
humane channel within the saw-mill, some wicked imp
suggested to our friend, the Provost Marshal, the feasibility
of his bestowing on us another kick. Hardly had
the lieutenant wiped the perspiration from his brow, and
looked around for a dry plank on which to sleep, when
a second Louisiana patriot, dirtier even than the first,
appeared. He delivered an order to the lieutenant. It
was to pack up and be off instantly—he, the Provost
Marshal, wouldn’t have prisoners camping in his town
over night.</p>

<p class='c011'>We accordingly packed up and went off, not more
than a hundred yards (for the saw-mill was on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>boundary of the town), and stopped at an abandoned
barn, just beyond the Provost Marshal’s jurisdiction.
The barn was dirty—the ground around it muddy—the
fleas were hale and hearty—and these little circumstances
added a great deal of force to the thanks which
the guard lavished on the Provost Marshal. Yet we
looked forward with hopefulness to the morrow, for then
we were to turn off from the Teche, and leaving civilization
and the hateful Louisianians behind us, strike
off, undisturbed, on the free prairies.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>V.<br /> <span class='large'>THE PRAIRIES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The road ran, for several miles, between hedges and
among plantations, and close to gardens and houses, with
their fields and fences, until it suddenly emerged on a
broad, unbounded prairie. Our guards’ eyes sparkled
when they saw it, and they declared that this began to
look like Texas. We all felt better at the sight, and the
fresh breeze that swept over it almost swept away the
weary weakness of the previous days. There is a profound
sense of loneliness and littleness on these great
seas of green far exceeding that which men feel in forests.
There is such an absence of <i>objects</i>—such long
distances appearing to the eye, and before which the
feet grow feeble—such a want of all shelter and protection,
that one wishes for the woods, and acknowledges a
companionship in hills and trees beyond all that he has
ever known before.</p>

<p class='c011'>A long noon-day halt was made at a Frenchman’s,
whose wretched shanty stood environed by a beautiful
grove of the deep-shading China tree; and, during the
afternoon, we found the prairie interspersed with small
plantations. These took away the sense of loneliness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>and, in some respects, added to the interest of the march.
There was a good stiff breeze, too, blowing directly from
the west, (to which we travelled) and all moved cheerfully
along, shaking off fatigue and forgetting, for the
time, that we were prisoners. As the sun approached
his setting, we descended by a gently sloping plain
toward a wood that marks and hides Vermillion Bayou.
While it was still a mile or two distant, we turned from
the wagon-trail and made our way across the prairie to
a plantation, whose large white house and numerous
out-buildings peered forth from a grove of over-hanging
trees.</p>

<p class='c011'>The plantation was owned by a lady, who kindly
allowed her servants to cook our supper, and gave us
her lawn to bivouac upon. She also invited Mr. and
Mrs. Stratford to occupy a room in her house, and
showed the rare good taste and delicacy of not coming
out to stare at us. We found ourselves still connected
with civilized life; for supper was spread out handsomely
in the dining-room, and was accompanied by the
luxury of real French coffee, served in delicate china.</p>

<p class='c011'>We started earlier than usual the next morning, and
soon crossed the strip of prairie between us and the Vermillion.
The belt of wood was not more than half a mile
in breadth, and near its farther edge we found a narrow,
sluggish stream, almost bridged by the ferry-scow, yet
deep in mud, and with miry banks that made it difficult
to cross. As we waited for the wagon that was slowly
rumbling along, we discovered below the ferry, closely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>drawn up against the bank and almost hidden by the
trees, a full rigged schooner, that had eluded the watchfulness
of our blockaders, and escaped the eyes of our
cavalry, and now lay snugly waiting for the proper time
to glide down the bayou and escape on the open sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>The wagon rolled up while we were scanning and
discussing the little blockade runner, and we began our
crossing. It was not a labor of very great importance,
for when one end of the scow had been pushed a few
feet from the eastern bank, the other end ran into the
western. We found the latter much higher than the
former, being, in Southern phrase, “something of a
bluff.” On mounting it, we saw a rolling prairie spreading
out like a lake of green, and enclosed by distant
woods which seemed its shore. The “timber,” (as forests
in the West are called,) was four or five miles distant
on either side, and, to the front of us, sank down
behind the far-off horizon. Numerous herds were in
sight; and troops of young cattle would draw up and
stare at us. They were not the “fine stock” of our good
breeders; yet, still were beautiful creatures—straight-backed,
fine-boned, and with heads gracefully carried
and erect. “When our shouts startled them into motion,
they carried themselves off with the same high horse-like
trot I had been struck with in our bull on the Teche, and
then, breaking into an easy gallop, bounded away like
deer. The guards repeatedly warned us to keep near
the horsemen, and said, that these cattle of the prairies
did not know what a man a-foot was, and were so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>wild that they would attack us if we ventured near
them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The guard had been improving daily since we left
Franklin. No formal parole was given by us, yet there
was an informal one which we respected, and in which
they placed implicit confidence. They behaved, too,
with great kindness, constantly dismounting and making
first one and then another of us ride. Our column
broke up into little parties of twos and threes, the faster
walkers opening gaps on those who took it more leisurely,
and each one travelling at whatever rate he best liked.
After five or six miles of this, three of us, with a like
number of the guard, reached a little house that stood
alone in the prairie. The guards showed their appreciation
of our honor, by handing us their horses and rifles
to take care of while they went into the house. After
a while they returned, and showed their appreciation of
our appetites by bringing us a pail full of milk for a
drink.</p>

<p class='c011'>We watched the different parties that dotted the
prairie for a mile or two behind us, until they severally
came up, wiping the perspiration from their faces and
throwing themselves on the grass beside us. The wagon
overtook us last, and then we rose and resumed the
march. The prairie continued to present the same rich
picture of beautiful seclusion. Occasionally its timber-shores
approached each other, and sometimes they
opened into successive lakes. Yet, with all this beauty,
we found ourselves becoming hot and weary. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>were no way-side trees to cast an occasional shade, and
no brooks or springs at which to halt and re-fill canteens.
The usual morning breeze that sweeps across the prairies,
as across the sea, went down, and wistful eyes were
thrown at a distant plantation which we saw embowered
in trees. Where the road to this cool retreat branched
off, Lieutenant Duncan ordered a halt, and then, with his
usual kindness, asked us to decide whether we would go
to the plantation and rest till evening, or push on and
finish our day’s work before we halted. There was some
little difference of opinion. Certain thirsty individuals,
who kept up a constant sucking at their canteens,
declared that they were nearly choked, notwithstanding
the three pints of water each had swallowed; others,
who had drunk nothing since we started, were in favor
of pushing on. It ended in the lieutenant sending one
of his men, laden with canteens, to the plantation, and
in our resuming the march.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Texan put his “pony” on the easy amble, which is
the leading trait of a Southern horse, and struck off in
a straight line toward the distant house. We could see
the horse and rider gradually sinking in the prairie as
they receded from us, until not much could be discerned
beside the wide-brimmed Texan hat. There was a little
interval, and then horse and rider re-appeared, striking
off at an angle which would intercept our line of march,
and travelling on the same easy amble. The horses of
the Texans, I must confess, had greatly disappointed me.
Half of them were miserable, ill-shaped ponies, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>could never have made or withstood a charge, and were
unworthy of the name of cavalry horses. And yet these
mounted troops of the Confederates have shown a wonderful
readiness and swiftness of movement, which have
often outwitted our generals and eluded our strategy,
and that too, in a country where our horses would have
starved. This great “mobility” I ascribe, in part, to the
ambling gait (forbidden in our service) which carries
them along some five miles an hour, without strain to
the horse or fatigue to the rider; and, in part, to the free
use of the lariat, which enables the horse to graze at
every momentary halt. Man and horse understood this
latter principle, for the former never dismounted without
twitching off the bridle, and the latter never stopped
without industriously picking up his living. In one respect
the Texans are careless of their horses, tearing off
the saddles the moment they halt, and never dreaming
of cold water either as a preventive or a cure of the sore
back that tortures nearly every horse.</p>

<p class='c011'>“While I was making these reflections, our column had
stretched out in its usual manner, and then broken into
small groups: these separated more and more as we advanced.
The guards told us that Turtle-Tail Bayou was
to be our camping ground, and they pointed to the timber,
which looked like a low cloud along the horizon.
How long this cloud was in changing into trees, and how
slowly these trees rose in view, no one can imagine who
has not travelled <i>a-foot</i> upon the prairies. The sun sent
down his usual burning rays as he approached the meridian,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>and a damp stifling heat rose from the grass.
Yet it is a great thing to be first in camp, and able
thereby to choose your own tree, and label it “<span class='fss'>TAKEN</span>,”
by pitching your haversack at its foot, and to lie down
and rest ere the slow walkers arrive. So the two or
three of us who led pushed on. The trees came slowly
more and more into view; the branches imperceptibly
rose; the grass beneath them appeared. Then the corporal
and his men left us and rode on to select the camping
ground. We followed slowlier on their trail, keeping
our eyes upon them until we saw them dismount
where timber and prairie met—unsaddle and turn loose
their horses, the welcome signs of our coming rest. The
sight gave vigor to our halting feet—on, on, without a
stop, though it was two miles, as the bird flies, to the
nearest tree. On, on, until panting and streaming, I
tear off my hat and haversack and drop them, with myself,
at the foot of a spreading oak.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There is no rest like that which comes after such,
exercise. I see again the little groups drawing nearer
across the prairie; coming in with sun-tinted faces and
dripping brows; speaking no words, unless a few tired
monosyllables; casting quick glances round for some
smooth, shaded spot of turf, then walking there and
dropping down. And last of all, the heavy, lumbering
wagon rumbling up; its tired passengers jolted, and
jaded, and cross, and broiled, yet still willing to find,
with particular care, a spot that pleases them, whilst the
teamster pulls the clattering harness from the mules,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>turns them loose upon the prairie, and, like the others,
drops down to silence and repose.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hour upon hour thus passed, partly in sleep and
partly in a dreamy languor of delicious rest. Then came
a little restlessness and glances at the sun—then the blue
smoke of a fresh-kindled camp-fire, and assertions that
A. and B. had risen, and were preparing (for themselves)
the one important meal. When such assertions had been
repeated twice or thrice around me, the ground, which
at first was softer than down, began to grow hard, and
withal somewhat knobby. I arose, and went with Lieutenant
Sherman to find the bayou. It was a stagnant
bed of pollywogs, not ten feet wide nor ten inches deep.
Crawling out on a log, nevertheless, and skimming off the
green, slimy scum, we dipped up the water and enjoyed,
as we had seldom enjoyed before, the luxury of a bath.
Returning to the camp-fire, we found that the guards,
mindful of their prisoners’ more tired condition, were
baking “dodgers” for all hands, and that the “dodgers”
were nearly done.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of us quickly clambered into the wagon, and cut
from the side of bacon a couple of slices, while the other
sharpened two slender sticks. The bacon, skewered on
these, was speedily toasted over the fire. A slice of
“dodger” took the place of plates and dishes; our
pocket-knives were also spoons and forks; and yet this
Texan supper in the open air, cooked by oneself, and
eaten after a twenty mile march and a twelve hour fast,
is as delicious a meal as was ever served.  The blankets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>were spread ere the dew fell. We lay gazing on
the stars, smoked lazily, and talked of to-morrow’s march,
till it grew dark. To me this camp brought back all
the interest of an old cavalry bivouac with some of its
most unpleasant parts left out. The sense of responsibility
was now gone. I had no anxiety or duty beyond
that of taking care of myself. There were no guards
for me to post; no pickets to visit; no rounds to make,
and no prisoners to watch.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again the blankets were rolled—the bacon toasted—the
dodger divided, and a cup of tea made. Of tired
nature’s sweet restorer, English breakfast tea—so much
perverted and abused in civilized life—we had a little
canister, and wondrous were the works which that little
canister performed. Its few ounces of simple-looking
herb—so light—so portable—so bulk-less, seemed to contain
strength sufficient for an army. Those who sipped
it, though weary and faint, grew strong and cheerful:
those who disliked it at home, confessed that it
tasted like nectar on the march. Ere the last sip was
taken, the corporal mounted the wagon and said, “Now,
gentlemen, please to pack along your little tricks.” The
“little tricks” were safely stowed by the gallant corporal,
on top of the rations; the sick and lame were
stowed on top of them; Mrs. Stratford took the seat reserved
for her; the well “fell in,” and again we
started.</p>

<p class='c011'>The road crossed the timber-belt, and emerged on
a lake-like prairie. It was that hour when the soft light
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>of the morning heightened the peculiar beauty which
this march revealed. The rising sun gilded the tree-tops
beside us, and tinged the soft expanse before. The
herds were moving slowly; some so near that we could
hear the sullen bellow of the bulls; and some so distant
that we could see only their long horns moving above the
green, looking like wild fowl floating on the surface of
the grassy sea. The prairie rose and fell in occasional
swells, the distant timber swept around it in the graceful
windings of a serpentine shore, and islets of trees
waved upon the bosom of this green and wood-bound
lake.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before the morning passed, I had an illustration
of a folly which pervades our army. The guards had
warned us that it was sixteen miles across this prairie,
and until it should be crossed, we should find no water.
Every canteen was therefore filled, as was a two-gallon
keg that had followed me through the lines. Several
years ago, Lieutenant-Colonel Frederick Townsend, of
the Eighteenth United States Infantry, in recounting to
me his sufferings while crossing the Gila desert, had laid
great stress upon the fact, that during the journey he
had made it a rule to go without drinking till he halted
for the night. Remembering this when I entered the
army, I subjected myself to like discipline, drinking only
when I ate. A single week made this a habit, and left
me comparatively comfortable and independent. On
this morning, I accordingly loaned my canteen to some
one foolish enough to need it, and walked along without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>the slightest feeling of thirst. It was not eleven o’clock,
and we had not marched six hours, when we came to a
puddle of water, filling the wagon-track. The water
was apparently the result of some local shower; it was
clear, but the road was dirty, and on one side, lying in
the water, were the putrid remains of an ox. I was
turning out to go around the puddle, when I heard my
friends behind shout to me to stop.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What for?” I asked, in much amazement at the
idea of halting in the wettest spot we could find.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, for a drink.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A drink! What, drink that filthy water?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Yes, they were thirsty enough to drink anything.
They must drink something; the canteens and keg had
been empty two hours. With accelerated speed, they
hurried to the margin of the puddle. Some knelt down
and drank, others ladled it up in their mugs, and several
actually filled their canteens with the decoction. Thus
had the little period of six hours swept away the
niceties of men who, in their own homes, would have
sickened at the thought of this loathsome draught; and
thus did a childish habit destroy the whole pleasure
of their walk, hide all the beauties of the landscape,
divert their attention from objects of interest, and subject
them to a needless annoyance, sometimes little less
than torture.</p>

<p class='c011'>The following day passed much like the others—our
road still leading us across several wood-encircled
prairies, separated from each other by narrow timber-belts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>and trivial, dried-up bayous. Early in the afternoon,
after a march of twenty-three miles, we reached a
bayou possessed of two or three names. From these, I
selected as the one easiest to be remembered, “Indian,”
and after crossing the place where the water of Indian
Bayou ought to have been, I found that we were to
encamp beyond the “timber,” and in a little grove.
This word “grove” is in constant use through western
Louisiana and Texas, and when first heard, it strikes the
educated ear as a specimen of the fine talk so common
in all parts of our country. But when these natural
<i>groves</i> are seen, the purest taste acknowledges that the
word is not misapplied. The one in which we now
encamped was an oval clump of the live-oak, so clear
and clean below, so exact and regular in form, that one
could hardly believe nature had not been aided by the
gardener’s art.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next morning our breakfast disclosed the fact,
that the Confederate bacon ration is not so large as the
military appetite. The lieutenant informed me that he
had no intention of starving in the midst of plenty, and
had sent forward two men to shoot a yearling, near a
certain bayou, and there we would halt and “barbecue”
the meat. From the time of leaving the Teche, the
prairies had been steadily growing drier. The atmosphere,
too, was clearer, the sky brighter, the air more
bracing and elastic, and though the sun was intensely
hot, yet there was not the damp, vaporous heat that is
so oppressive in the lower prairies of Louisiana. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>day we were to cross a “dry-prairie,” and as we had at
last succeeded in an early start (4–45), we reached it
before the heat of the day had begun. A very dreary
waste it was, unenlivened by the usual herds, its scanty
herbage dried and withered up, and its wide expanse
barren and desolate. It was, if I remember aright, nine
miles across, but seemed much farther, for the road was
soft and sandy, and with every breeze, a cloud of dust
travelled down upon us. As the nine miles lessened
into one, and the stunted trees that bordered the dry-prairie
came in view, our two beef-hunters also could be
seen driving down their half-wild game toward the
road. Being somewhat in advance, I struck off to join
them. Ere I accomplished this, a young heifer broke
from the herd and bounded away. Instantly one of the
rifles flashed and the heifer fell. The shot attracted the
corporal, and in a moment his little bay was coming pell-mell
across the broken ground, leaping some gullies and
scrambling in and out of others, until he threw himself
back on his haunches beside us. The corporal looked
with great interest at what they called the “yuhlin,”
inquired how far they had driven it (some eight miles),
and enlarged on our great luck in getting so fat a “beef”
on so poor a “range.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was somewhat of a mystery to me how the “yuhlin”
would be carried to camp. When I asked whether the
wagon, or perhaps the leading pair of mules, would be
brought round to tow it in, the corporal laughed, and
said in his merry way, that he would show us how they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>carried their game home in Texas. Forthwith he took
his ever-useful lariat, and making fast one end to the
“yuhlin’s” horns, wound the other round the horn of
his Mexican saddle. One of the men attached another
in like manner, and thus harnessed, the two horses
dragged the heifer as they would a log. The saddles,
girthed for “roping” cattle, did not yield, and the
horses tugged away with as much unconcern as though
they were pulling by the ordinary collar and traces.</p>

<p class='c011'>The mile between us and the halting-place was soon
passed over, and all hands seemed to feel a deep,
immediate interest in the “yuhlin.” Although we had
marched eighteen miles that morning, it was not eleven
o’clock; nevertheless there were suggestions of <i>fresh</i>
steaks, and the deserter (who really seemed to try to
eat all he could, so as to be in some measure even with
men who had less ripened chances of being shot) proceeded
to bake a dodger. The corporal had unsaddled
his horse in a trice, and was now elbow deep in breaking
up the “yuhlin.” Another corporal—a quiet, hardworking,
unassuming German—prepared the frame
for barbecuing the meat. This consisted of poles placed
horizontally, about three feet from the ground. Beneath
it a slow fire was made, and the meat, cut up in thin
slices, was spread on the poles. In three or four hours
it was partly dried and partly cooked into a half-hard
state, and was then said to be barbecued. Meanwhile
an army of hogs came out of the woods, lean and
savage, and grunted impatiently for their share of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“yuhlin.” A smaller but not less impatient party
waited, with drawn knives and sharpened sticks, till the
steaks could be cut, and then hurried with them to their
several fires. A steak thus cooked upon hard-wood
embers retains a flavor that the best French <i>chef</i>, with
charcoal range, only approaches. And when this flavor
is intensified by the fresh breezes of the prairie, and the
long miles of a day’s march, it is not wonderful that
men affirm that steaks cut from buffalo or stag, or
even from a poor little half-tamed “yuhlin,” are better
than the best butcher’s meat that can be bought at
home.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When the meat was all barbecued, we pushed forward
for the Calcasieu. The river formed a dividing line
between a forest and a prairie country. At the foot of a
slight bluff was a flat-boat and rope-ferry. I learnt
from the ferryman, with much surprise, that our “gun-boat
boats” had been up there, and captured a steamer
and several schooners. I wished most ardently as we
stepped aboard the flat, that they might re-appear at
that particular moment, and enable us to return the
good treatment of our guards, by providing for their
wants in New Orleans. The wish was not realized, and
the scow, like a gentler craft, wafted us to the other
shore. There an unexpected individual hailed our
approach, in the person of a bright-looking mule, who,
solitary and sad, was travelling briskly toward the
ferry. The corporal, who, as usual, led, answered the
mule in his way, and quickly uncoiled the lariat. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>mule tried a dodge, but the lariat flew straight over his
head and tight around his neck. The mule was fairly
“roped.” The corporal gave an inspiriting yell, and
examined the brand. It was an unknown brand—a
Louisianian brand—and the mule was therefore adjudged
a lawful prize.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Our road now wound through the green woods and
along the bank of the winding river. The sun, which
at first was behind us, moved round upon our left, then
swung in front, then passed beside us on our right, then
speedily changed back, and shone again before us. The
foliage screened the river, but frequent openings uncovered
views of these river-bends, and of the clear,
dark water flowing beside us. Could a section of the
Calcasieu be cut out and transplanted to the environs of
some great city, the rich luxuriance of its banks, clad
with verdure from the vines that trail upon the water to
the tops of the tall firs and deep-green magnolias that
overhang the stream—its constant windings and its
graceful curves, would be deemed a marvel of picturesque
beauty. Yet here the traveller finds in it only a
dull monotony of never-ceasing turnings, and sees in the
beautiful foliage of its banks, only a dreary loneliness.
I listened to a Texan’s description, and doubted
whether it had ever received an admiring glance before
my own. This wood, too, through which we marched,
was not the foul swamp of eastern Louisiana. There
was the cool, deep shade, the dreamy stillness, the sweet,
wild perfume of our northern forests. The trees aided,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>too, in the brief delusion. We knew the rough branches
of the oak and the needles of the “fadeless pine.”
Large gum-trees deceived us into the belief that they
were the maples of a “sugar-bush;” and dwarfed magnolias,
at the first glance, took the semblance of the
hickory. There was also a delightful refreshingness in
the cool, shadeful river-bank, and our long march through
prairies, exposed and shelterless, helped us to realize
“the sweet retirement” of the woods.</p>

<p class='c011'>For four miles we marched with spirit and pleasure,
although they made up the sum of twenty-five for that
day’s work. Then halting, on a sandy bluff covered
with pines, we encountered a legion of troubles. The
gnats were terrible—the mosquitoes fearful—the pine
smoke spoilt our steaks—the fresh breeze of the prairie
did not reach us—and our longest march was followed
by a restless night. All the next day our road continued
in the “piny-woods.” There were occasional
openings, and the ground was clear of underbrush, yet
most of the party wished themselves back on the prairie,
and thought the light shade of the pines a poor return
for the prairie breeze. As it was Sunday, we halted
early, and the lieutenant told us that one day more
would bring us to Niblett’s Bluff.</p>

<p class='c011'>For two days we lay idle at the Bluff, with no better
recreation than yawning and cooking. On the third,
the Beaumont boat arrived. Some Vicksburg paroled
prisoners had, meanwhile, come in, and they spoke of
our soldiers in terms which were most cheering to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>us. They were as brave as men could be—they had
treated them like brothers—they had given them all the
rations they could carry with them, and they had
behaved “a heap better every way” than it was supposed
Yankees could. They said this not only to us, but
to other soldiers and citizens, and spoke up boldly on our
behalf. The effect was agreeable, not in any material
change, but in good feeling and in the greater kindliness
with which we were treated. The boat started the next
morning at daybreak. We descended the Sabine and
ascended the Neches, reaching Beaumont in the evening.
At this place there was a railway eating-house,
that gave us a greasy breakfast, for a dollar and a half;
we also bought sugar for a dollar a pound, and watermelons
for a dollar apiece. These prices seemed enormous
at the time, but subsequent experience makes
them appear quite reasonable.</p>

<p class='c011'>We left the little town of Beaumont on an open platform
car of the Houston train. Lieutenant Duncan
made an effort to have us placed in the passenger cars,
but they were full. The news of Vicksburg had reached
here some time before us, and the coming of the Vicksburg
prisoners was expected. At every station were
anxious faces, sometimes made glad and sometimes going
away more anxious than they came. At one of these,
there were two women, evidently a mother and her
daughter. The train had hardly stopped, when I heard
a shriek, which sounded like one of agony, but was
instantly followed by the words, “O my son, I’m so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>glad, I’m so glad, I’m so glad!” I looked and saw a
fine young fellow, who had told us many tales of the
sufferings of the siege, running toward the woman, and
the next moment folded in her arms. Unconscious of
the many eyes upon them, the mother hung upon his
neck, and the sister held his hand. Some friends tossed
him his roll of blankets, but it fell unnoticed. The train
started, but they did not look around, and when we
were far out upon the prairie, they still stood there exchanging
their eager words, and seemingly unconscious
that we had left them.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was twilight when the train ran into Houston. A
crowd was on the platform, made up of families and
friends, who had come there to welcome their sons and
brothers from the dreadful siege. There was a line of
young girls upon the edge of the platform, and as our
car was the first of the train, they of course saw us while
looking for their friends. It was interesting to observe
the different expressions that passed over the line of
pretty faces as their eyes scanned us. At first a look
of anxious interest—a shade of disappointment—a start
of surprise—a slight shrinking back with side glances
at each other and the whispered-word, “<i>prisoners</i>”—and
then, in most cases, a little glance of pity. But our
car ran past them, and the next moment were heard the
usual sounds that welcome long-absent soldiers to their
homes—loud congratulations, eager inquiries, laughter
and kisses. A little shade of sorrow, and perhaps of
envy, fell on us. We stood apart, a small group unnoticed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>as unknown. I tried to repress the dangerous
feeling, but insensibly my thoughts flew far away to
those who would thus have welcomed us.</p>

<p class='c011'>The kindness of Lieutenant Duncan continued unabated.
We had shouldered our knapsacks, but he sent
for carts, and insisted on conveying them for us. Before
the Provost Marshal’s, a small crowd assembled, but it was
quiet and respectful. An officer of the provost guard
came out. He took the roll and called it, made sure
that all were present, and informed Lieutenant Duncan
that he was relieved from the further charge of us. We
were faced, and marched to what had been the Court
House. Our old guard accompanied us. They attempted
to carry in our things, but were stopped at the
door. There they shook hands warmly, and wished us
a speedy exchange. We turned down a dark stone passage
and entered a room. There were bars on the window,
and the moonlight fell in little checkered squares
upon the dirty floor. The corporal of the guard, brought
in our baggage—sent out and bought us some bread—asked
if we wanted anything else—and then drew out a
key. With the sight of that key, all conversation
ceased. It was a wand of silence. No one spoke or
moved or looked elsewhere. Every eye remained fixed
on the key. The corporal inserted it in the door. It
went in slowly and grated horribly, unlike the grating
of a house key, or an office key, or a safe key, or a stable
key, or any kind of a key, <span class='fss'>SAVE ONE!</span> The corporal
looked around and said, good night. No one had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>breath enough to respond. The corporal stepped out
and the door closed, not with a bang or a slam or a
crash, but with a heavy, ominous, awful sound. There
was still an instant of suspense, a small infinitesimal
fraction of a faint hope, and then the key turned, grating
with an indescribable sound, such as none of us ever
heard key give forth before. With a great effort I withdrew
my eyes from the door-lock, and looked around the
room. All were seated on their blankets, and ranged
round, with their backs against the walls. The moonlight
checkers still fell on the floor. I felt that somebody
must speak, that if somebody did not speak soon,
some of us would never speak again. I thought that I
would speak—I made another great effort, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a singular sound a key makes when somebody
else turns it; did you ever remark it before? I suppose
<i>you</i> have.”</p>

<p class='c011'>One man laughed—all laughed. Lieutenant Sherman
came promptly to my aid, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“How pretty that moonlight is on the floor! <i>Who</i>
cares for the bars.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And then we had (apparently) a very jolly evening,
in the dark.</p>

<p class='c011'>As this military prison has not a very good name
among prisoners, and some who have been confined
there have had to wait a day or two for rations, and
then a day or two more to get them cooked, I feel bound
to say that the guard brought us a very good breakfast
the next morning, which I took to be a part of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>own. They brought us also word that we should be
sent by the morning cars to Camp Groce.</p>

<p class='c011'>With alacrity we shouldered our knapsacks, and lugged
our remaining “traps” to the cars; and with a sense
akin to freedom, we hurried away from those picturesque
bars and that detestable lock. There was a little detention
at the depot, and then we were placed in a “first-class
passenger car” with first-class passengers, and
rolled along toward the prisoners’ camp. The conductor
soon came upon his rounds, and as he passed me, asked
in a whisper, if there were any Massachusetts officers
among the prisoners. He was a tall, fine-looking man,
with the tightness and trimness of dress that no one ever
finds in a Southerner. I asked who he was, and learnt
that he was Lieutenant-Governor B——, of Massachusetts.
The fact was even so—an ex-Lieutenant-Governor
of Massachusetts was a conductor on the South Western
Railroad of Texas!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here is your stopping-place, gentlemen,” said the
sergeant of our guard. We looked from the car windows,
and saw long barracks of rough boards, like an
enclosed cow-shed. In front was a pretty grove, and
in the rear a sloping hill. At the doors of the barracks
we saw clusters of blue-jackets, and a few sauntered
around the buildings. We toiled up a sandy bank;
the roll was called, and we were “turned over” to
the commanding officer. Captain Buster greeted us
kindly, and said he was sorry to see us; he had been a
prisoner twenty-two months in the dungeons of Mexico,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>and knew what it was. He marshalled us down to the
barracks, and formally presented us to Captain Dillingham,
the senior officer of the naval prisoners. We
entered the barracks. They were like most such buildings,
long and narrow, with bunks around the sides, and
tables for the well and cots for the sick. The officers
occupied the first compartment. They crowded around
us, with eager questions, and showed us kindness and
hospitality beyond our expectations. We selected such
bunks as were still empty, unpacked our knapsacks, and
made our arrangements for the night, and the many
nights that were to follow. We studied the faces of our
new companions, and found that they were for the most
part sick and sad. We talked to them, and found that
they were unhappy and dejected. Half a year’s imprisonment
had manifestly changed them from energetic,
active men, to listless, idle, irritable invalids. We asked
ourselves whether it could have a like effect on us, and
answered that it could not.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>It is not a pleasant thing to be a prisoner; I never enjoyed
it, and never made the acquaintance of any prisoner
who said that he did. True is it that you have but few
cares and responsibilities. In the prisoners’ camp you
take no heed of what you shall eat, or what you shall
drink, or wherewith you shall be clothed. If the rations
come, you can eat them; and if they do not, you can
go without; in neither case have your efforts any thing
to do with the matter. Your raiment need not trouble
you; for there vanity has no place, and rags are quite
as honorable as any other style of dress. You are never
dunned by importunate creditors, and if, by possibility,
you were, it would be a sufficient bar in law and equity
to say that you would not pay. There you are not
harassed by pressing engagements, or worried by clients
or customers. There you have no fear of failure, and
may laugh at bankruptcy. And yet, with all these advantages,
no man ever seeks to stay in this unresponsible
paradise.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>I found that there was a horrible sense of being a
prisoner—of being in somebody’s possession—of eating,
drinking, sleeping, moving, living, by somebody’s permission;
and worst of all, <i>that</i> somebody the very enemy
you had been striving to overcome. There was a feeling
of dependence on those who were the very last persons
on whom you were willing to be dependent. There
was a dreary sense of constraint in your freest hours, of
being shut in from all the world, and having all the
world shut out from you.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the first days of imprisonment the novelty carried
the new prisoners along, and buoyed them up. Then
came a season of work, when they built cabins and made
stools and tables; and then, a restless fit, when they felt
most keenly the irksomeness of the life, and made foolish
plans to escape, which (so the “old prisoners” said) had
been tried before and failed. Then the “new prisoners”
would grow quiet and sad. The most of them would
become idle, inert, neglectful of their dress and quarters,
peevish and listless, despondent of exchange, yet indifferent
to all present improvement. A few (about one in
ten) would struggle to make matters better; they would
take hopeful views of affairs and perform active work on
things around them.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a day or two after our arrival at Camp Groce we
lay by, idle and weary. As I thus looked on, and saw
the listless despondency of the “old prisoners,” I discovered
quickly that those were happiest who were busiest.
Experience since has confirmed me in the value
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>I early set on <i>occupation</i>. Those labors which the rebels
have imposed on our men—the chopping of wood—the
building of houses—the cooking of rations—have been,
I think, the prisoner’s greatest blessings. Our active
northern minds chafe at enforced idleness, and the freshly
caught Yankee, or Hoosier, after the work of cabin
building is done, and the rough tables and stools are
made, becomes dejected and then sick; and yet while he
was doing the work at which he growled, both soul and
body bore up easily. It is no wonder then that I said
to my lieutenant, “This will never do for us, Sherman,
we <i>must</i> be busy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>We turned over a new leaf, therefore, for the following
day. The Captain of the “Morning Light” joined us and
pledged himself to provide and devise quantities of work.
With the first gleam of light one of us rose, and from a
little private hoard abstracted a small handful of coffee.
These sailor prisoners, I early found, had no idea of going
without while the Confederacy could supply them for
either love or money (they did not care much which);
and they inspired the rest with a little of their own easy
impudence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Accordingly on the door-post hung one of the last
coffee-mills that the shops of Houston had held, and in
the galley (as they called the kitchen) stood a stove—the
only one, probably, in any Texan camp. The first
riser then kindled a fire in the stove, if it was not already
there, and ground and made the coffee. Then bearing
it to the sleepers’ bunks, he quickly roused them with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>the cheerful salutation of “Here’s your coffee—your
fine hot coffee!” When a tin mug of coffee is the only
luxury of the day it rises in importance and becomes
great. We sipped it slowly and discussed it gravely.
One thought that if it were strained a fourth time it
would be stronger—the maker, on the contrary, thought
that straining it again would take the strength out;
a second insisted that it ought to boil—but the maker
maintained that boiling dispelled the aroma and sent it
flying through the air. The coffee ended before the
argument; and then after rinsing out our mugs and restoring
them to their private pegs, we took down our
towels and started for the “branch.” We descended
the hill by a little path that was nearly hidden in tall
weeds and led to some thick bushes and trees that grew
along the “branch.” The chain of sentinels around the
camp consisted of broad-hatted Texans, sitting at irregular
intervals on stumps and logs, and generally engaged
in balancing their rifles on their knees. One of these,
Captain Dillingham hailed in a patronizing way, in return
for which attention the sentry halted us.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I reckon,” he said, “you can’t go no further jist yit
awhile.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Halloo,” said the Captain, “what’s the matter
now?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, there be three down there now, and the orders
is not to let no more down to once.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Orders?” said the Captain, indignantly: “who cares
for orders! What difference does it make to Jeff Davis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>whether there are three prisoners or six washing themselves?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I reckon it don’t make an awful sight of difference,”
the sentry admitted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course it doesn’t,” said the Captain, following
up the concession. “The idea of making us wait <i>here</i>
because there’s somebody down <i>there</i>!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I reckon you might as well go on,” yielded
the sentry: “I reckon you won’t run off this morning;”
and on we went.</p>

<p class='c011'>The “branch” was a little brook, sometimes running
over sand-bars, sometimes filtering through them, and
occasionally settling into pools, which were our bathing
places. It was a happy relief to be out of sight of the
barracks and alone. We clung to this under all sorts
of difficulties and restrictions—sometimes going out with
a patrol—sometimes squeezing through on parole, and
holding fast to it, until we left Camp Groce in the cold
weather of December.</p>

<p class='c011'>The bath being taken, we walked leisurely back, wondering
that so few sought this relief from the misery of
prison. At the barracks our sailor cook had prepared
the breakfast, which was set out on the long table. He
blew his boatswain’s whistle, and all members of the
mess hurried at the call. I had felt poor when I arrived
at Camp Groce. I had expected to broil beef on sticks,
and bake dodger in a dodger pot, and live on my ration
as the Texans did. I was amazed at the extravagance
I beheld, and when Captain Dillingham, with a sailor’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>heartiness, invited me to join the navy mess, I hinted to
him that probably I should become insolvent in a fortnight,
if I did. The Captain laughed at the idea. He
said there was plenty of money in Texas—he had never
seen a country that had so much money—and it was the
easiest thing to get it—anybody would lend you all you
wanted—the only fault he had to find was, that after
he got it he couldn’t spend it. Now, making reasonable
allowances for nautical exaggeration, this was true.
Sometimes a secret Unionist—sometimes a Confederate
officer fairly forced his money upon us. They took no obligation,
save the implied one of our honor; and the
manner of payment, and the specie value of their Confederate
funds, they left entirely to ourselves. To spend
this money was a harder task. To change this easily
gotten spoilt paper into something of real intrinsic worth
was to acquire wealth.</p>

<p class='c011'>When breakfast was finished, I took up a little French
volume of ghost stories (which I read over five times
carefully in the course of the next five months), and
spent on it and some military works the next four hours.
“Prisoners have nothing to do but to eat;” so at the end
of four hours we had our breakfast over again. When
“dinner,” as it was called, was finished, the Captain
stoutly asserted that a load of wood must be got, and
somebody must volunteer to get it. The Captain volunteered,
so did Lieutenant Sherman and myself, so did
another officer cheerfully, and two more tardily; but
the mass of closely confined prisoners were too weak and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>too dejected, and they shrunk back from the effort that
this work would cost them, preferring to stay idle
and listless in their horrid prison. Those of us who
volunteered, seized a couple of dull old axes, and proceeded
to head-quarters.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We are going out for wood to cook with,” said the
Captain to the lieutenant that we found there, “and we
must have an arbor to keep the sun off those sick fellows,
or they’ll all die, and you’ll have nobody to exchange.
Wake up one or two of your men, and send them out
with us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The lieutenant reckoned he could not, he hadn’t a
man to spare, all were on guard who hadn’t gone off to
a race. The Captain pointed to the axes and said, “we
were all ready to go.” This struck the lieutenant as a
powerful reason, and he reckoned he would let a nigger
hitch up the mules, and then let us go without any guard,
but we must not go across the “branch.” The Captain
replied that we would not go a great way across the
“branch;” but he was fond of liberty, he said, and
would not be circumscribed by “branches.” The lieutenant
insisted on the “branch,” there had been orders
given to that effect, he reckoned. The Captain did not
care anything about orders—what difference could it
make to Jeff Davis, he asked, whether we cut wood on
this side of the “branch” or the other. The lieutenant
could not answer this question, so he said, coaxingly,
“Well, you won’t go a great ways on the other side, will
you?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>This little difference being thus compromised, we
mounted an old rickety “two-mule wagon,” and drove
down the “wood road,” till a sentry, sitting on a stump,
reckoned we had better stop. <i>Stop!</i> what should
we stop for? He reckoned he’d orders to let nobody
out. <i>Orders!</i> Why, we had just been up to head-quarters,
and got orders to go out, and also the wagon;
what more could he want. Then why had not the lieutenant
sent down a man to tell him; it was no way to
do business. The Captain said the wagon was pass
enough as long as the mules would travel, and that we
were going out for wood, which he thought altered the
case; if he, the sentry, doubted it, there were the axes.
The sentry looked at the axes, and could not doubt the
evidence of his eyes, so he let us out.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sun went down, and then began a long evening.
There was nothing to do but to sit in the dark and talk of
nothing. Then there was a detail made of two for the
sick watch, and finding that I was “on,” I went to bed.
In the morning there had been several late sleepers who
wondered why people got up early and ran a coffee-mill.
As a matter of course these individuals now wondered
why people went to bed early and wanted to sleep. The
topics, too, which they chose were exactly the topics
that always keep you awake; and if by chance you forgot
them long enough to fall asleep, then there would
be a furious argument on some important matter; and
if that did not waken you, then some other man (who,
like yourself, turned in at taps,) would lose patience and
roar out, “taps,” “lights out,” “guard-house,” etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>In small assemblages men may wake up and fall
asleep when they please, but in camps and barracks,
where many men of different habits are brought together,
there must be some uniform rule for all. The Confederates
never enforced military usage upon us, much to the
regret of all who were accustomed to it, and a few very
early and very late individuals, some of whom sat up
till after taps, and others of whom turned out before reveille,
were an endless annoyance to each other and to
all. I think no officer of experience ever ran this gauntlet
without inwardly resolving that, if ever he got back
to his own command, stillness and darkness should rule
between taps and reveille; that with daylight every
blanket should go out, and every tent be put in order;
that every shaggy head should be clipped, and all the
little regulations which weak-minded recruits think to
be “military tyranny,” should be most rigorously enforced.</p>

<p class='c011'>But as I tossed around and made these resolves, the
little sailor who was acting as hospital steward came in
with both hands full of prescriptions. We had two excellent
and faithful surgeons at Camp Groce, Dr. Sherfy
of the “Morning Light,” and Dr. Roberts of the Confederate
service. They kept their little office outside of
the lines, came round on their second visit in the afternoon,
and during the evening made up their prescriptions.
This evening the first watch took the prescriptions
from the hospital steward, and received the directions.
It was Lieut. Hays, of the 175th N. Y., a happy,
generous, warm-hearted Irishman, youthful and with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>the humor and drollery of his race. He was always
making fun when others were dull, and making peace
when they were angry. Soon I heard him going round
among the sick. “I will listen,” I thought, “and find
out what I have to do when my watch comes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here’s your medicine now, Mr. Black,” I heard him
say, “wake up and take it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it?” asked the sick man.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! it’s blue pills to touch your liver; come, take
it, and don’t be asking questions.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How many of them are there?” inquired the patient
after swallowing several.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are just seven of them, but what’s that to
you? it won’t do you any good to know it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, the doctor said he would send me six. Perhaps
you are not giving me mine.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just you take what’s sent to you. If you don’t take
the whole seven, they won’t touch your liver a bit; six
would be of no use at all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The man with the untouched liver swallowed the pills,
and soon I heard the first watch rousing another sick
man with the same formula of “Here’s your medicine
now, wake up and take it—it’s blue pills to touch your
liver.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How many of them are there?” asked this patient.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are just six of them—what’s the use of your
knowing?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, the doctor said he would send me seven—perhaps
these are not mine.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>“No matter, six are just as good as seven, and seven
are just as good as fifty. All you need do is to take what
I give you, and it will touch your liver all the same.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Much enlightened by this mode of distributing doses,
and re-assuring patients, I went to sleep, and slept till
one <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, when the first watch called me, and I took my
turn. It was rather dreary, sitting in the dark and cold,
occasionally giving a man his medicine or a drink, and
wishing for daylight. There was one poor fellow, also
a lieutenant of the 175th, fast going in consumption.
His constant cough, his restless sleep, his attenuated
form, bright eye and hectic cheek, all told of the coming
end. Yet with him there was nothing to be done
but wait and watch.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now this, of itself, was not such a bad sort of day;
but there was a month of such days; and then another
month, and then a third, and then many more. What
wonder that the strongest resolutions failed!</p>

<p class='c011'>Then death came in among our little company, and
came again and again. Then sickness increased under
the August sun. The long moss that hung down from
the trees and waved so gracefully on the breeze, had betokened
it long before it came, and the uncleaned camp
and listless life made the prediction sure. It went on
until all but one had felt it in some shape or other, and
there were not enough well to watch the sick. It never
left us, and down to our last day at Camp Groce the
chief part of our company were frail and feeble and
dispirited.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>Near to the barracks stood a little shanty of rough
boards, divided by a plank partition into two rooms.
One of these had been assigned to Mr. Stratford and
his wife, and the other after several weeks came into the
possession of Col. Burrell of the 42d Mass., Dr. Sherfy,
Capt. Dillingham and myself. After living amid the
sickness, the discord, and the misery of the barracks, this
room measuring ten feet by twelve, promised to four of
us a quiet and retirement that amounted almost to happiness.
We went to work upon our little house with all
the zeal of school-boys, and positively look back upon it
with affection. It boasted doors, but neither windows
nor chimney. Its walls were without lath and plaster,
and through innumerable chinks let in the wind. The
Captain and I also messed with Mr. and Mrs. Stratford;
so we had a double interest in the shanty, and when we
had built ourselves bunks and swung a shelf or two,
we went to work on our other half.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What shall I do for a blanket line?” was one of the
first questions I had asked after our arrival.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let me lend you mine,” said an officer of the “Morning
Light,” “we sailors always hang on to our ropes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will take it this morning, with thanks; but I want
something of my own. If there is anything I despise, it’s
a soldier’s blanket in his tent after reveille.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We are not so particular here, I’m sorry to say,”
said my friend; “and unless you can find a line among
the sailors, you won’t find one in Texas.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am going out in the woods this afternoon, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Mr. Fowler,” I answered, “and will try to get one
there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, Mr. Fowler, the acting Master of the “Morning
Light,” was an old sailor, who had hardly been on shore
for forty years. But in his early boyhood he had
watched the Indians at their work, and caught from
them, as boys do, some of their simple medicines and
arts. For years and years these facts had slept undisturbed
in his mind. If any one had asked him, he would
have said they were forgotten; but now, under the pressure
of our wants, they, one by one, came back. With
this long-time worthless knowledge, Mr. Fowler was
now busily and usefully employed. He made Indian
baskets of all shapes and sizes, and even bent his ash-slips
into fantastic dishes. He made Indian brooms and
fly-brushes, and wooden bowls, and wove grape-vine and
black-jack into high-backed, deep-seated, sick-room
chairs. Where others saw only weeds or firewood, he
found remedies for half our diseases; and when the
surgeon’s physic gave out, Mr. Fowler’s laboratory was
rich in simples.</p>

<p class='c011'>We went out on parole that afternoon, Mr. Fowler
carrying his basket, and I, an axe. He called attention
to the fact that these pecan nuts would be ripe by-and-by,
and that those persimmons would be worth coming
after when the frost should have sugared them, and he
filled his basket as he walked and talked. Before long,
we saw some clean black-jack vines hanging from the
top-most branches of a tree. We tugged and strained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>a few minutes, and then a splendid vine came down,
not thicker than a lady’s finger at the root, yet forty feet
in length. It was flexible as a rope, and as I coiled it
up, I said to Mr. Fowler, “I have got my blanket
line.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Having cut an ash stick for a broom, and a pecan log
for an axe handle, we went back to camp, where, soon
after, Mr. Fowler was busily engaged in pounding his
ash stick to loosen the splints, and I, at work on the
severest manual effort of my life, viz., whittling with a
soft-bladed penknife, out of flinty pecan wood, an orthodox
American axe-helve.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some weeks passed, and then one of those events occurred
which are doubly mortifying if you are then on
the wrong side of the enemy’s lines. I was lying ill in
my bunk when an excited individual rushed into the
barracks and made me better by the announcement, that
the train had brought up great news from Houston.
Blunt was coming down through the Indian Territory with
his rough borderers, and all the troops in Texas were to
be hurried northward to repel the invasion. For several
days and nights trains ran by our camp loaded with soldiers
who howled horribly to our guards, who howled,
horribly back to them. The <cite>Houston Telegraph</cite> came
filled with orders of General Magruder, directing the
movement of his forces, and naming twenty-seven different
battalions that were to hurry forward immediately.
The General did not <i>publish</i> such orders ordinarily, and
this one looked like haste, excitement and alarm.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>One night, about ten o’clock, an engine was heard
hurrying up the road. As usual it stopped at the water-tank
near our camp. In ten minutes important news
had leaped from the engine to head-quarters; from
head-quarters to the guard-house, and from the guard-house
straight through the line of sentries into our bunks.
The news was this: twelve Yankee gun-boats, twenty-four
large transports, and six thousand men lay off
Sabine.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next day the train confirmed the news. We
learnt, too, that Union men, in Houston, were bold and
defiant, and talked openly of a change of masters. Our
guards were in a ferment. They talked with us freely,
and confessed that there were not three hundred troops
between Houston and Sabine. “Your folks will seize
the railroad and march straight on to Houston,” they
said, “and then Galveston will have to go, and like as
not you’ll be guarding us within a week.” “What
splendid strategy,” said everybody. “Blunt has drawn
all the forces in the State up to Bonham—there is
nothing to prevent our coming in below; Magruder is
completely out-generalled. We must forgive the two
months of idleness since Vicksburg and Port Hudson
fell.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Another day came, and the excitement increased;
another, and affairs seemed in suspense; a third, and
there was a rumor that two gun-boats had been sunk,
their crews captured, and that the “Great Expedition”
was “skedaddling” (such was the ignominious term applied)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>back to New Orleans. There came yet another
day, when we sat waiting for the train.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The cars are late,” said one. “It is past three
o’clock, and they should have been here at two.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s a good sign,” said another; “it shows they
have something to keep them. When they come you
will see Magruder is sending off his ordnance stores.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you don’t feel any fear about that rumor?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That rumor, oh no! It is the best sign of all. They
never fail to get up such rumors when they are being
beaten. Don’t you remember how, just before Vicksburg
surrendered, we used to hear that Breckenridge
had taken Baton Rouge, and Taylor was besieging New
Orleans, and Lee had burnt Philadelphia?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh no,” said everybody, stoutly, “there is no danger.
And how can there be? We know that there is
nothing down there but a little mud fort, with fifty men
in it, and six forty-two pounders. Our hundred-pound
Parrots will knock it to pieces, and a couple of companies
can carry it by assault. Oh no, all I am afraid
of is, that <i>we</i> shall be run off, nobody knows where.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The whistle sounded and we waited for the news.
The track ran through a deep cutting, which at first hid
the body of the cars from our sight, but a man stood on
the roof of the foremost baggage car and waved his hat.
Presently a howl was given by those of our guard who
were waiting at the station.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What can that mean?” said everybody. “Very
strange! surely there can be no bad news for us.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>The next moment, some one exclaimed, “Good heavens,
what a sight! Look there!” I looked; the train
was covered with the blue-jackets of our navy.</p>

<p class='c011'>The officers of the “Clifton” and “Sachem” did not accompany
their men. We heard that they were guilty of
spiking their cannon, flooding their magazines, secreting
their money, and other like offences, for which they
were kept at Houston; later, however, they unexpectedly
came up. A new Captain, who then commanded
Camp Groce, ushered them in, and we welcomed them.
The youngest of us then had been prisoners more than
three months, and felt ourselves to be “old prisoners.”
The Captain of the “Clifton” supped with us, and as he
surveyed our little shanty, replete with black-jack lines,
hat-racks of curiously twisted branches, knives, and
spoons, and salt-cellars, neatly carved from wood, and
pipes fashioned out of incomparable corn-cob, he said
that these little luxuries made him feel sorry for us, for
they showed him what straits we had been reduced to.
I felt sorry for him as he said it, for the speech reminded
me of the lessons reserved for him to learn. Later than
usual we retired, excited with this unusual event. The
barracks had just grown quiet, when the Captain in
command suddenly re-appeared, his guard at his back.
“The gentlemen who arrived to-day,” he said, in an
agitated voice, “will please to rise immediately.” The
new-comers rose, groped round for clothes and baggage
in the dark; and as they dressed, asked what all this
meant. The Captain vouchsafed no reply, but in a still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>more agitated voice, begged them to be as quick as possible.
Whether they were going to be searched, or
executed, or sent back to Houston, nobody could determine.
They were marched off, and we, now wide awake,
discussed the matter for some hours. The next morning
disclosed our friends haplessly shivering around a small
building, some three hundred yards distant. It appeared
that strict orders had been sent up with the prisoners,
directing that they should be confined separately, and
hold no communication with us. The now unhappy
Captain had not thought it worth while to read his
orders until bed-time. Then he stumbled on the fiat of
the stern Provost Marshal General, whose chief delight
was to court-martial Confederate captains. Deeply dismayed,
he had rushed to the guard-house for his guard,
to the barracks for his prisoners, and executed the painful
work of separation.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Provost Marshal General had not enclosed subsistence
in his order. In the absence of dodger-pots, the
“old prisoners” had to take care of these new ones. We
were not allowed to write or talk, to send messages or
to receive them. The baskets, as they went and came,
were searched, the dodgers broken open, and everything
was done in a very military and terrible way. In a few
days we received a present of pea-nuts from our friends.
We were not fond of pea-nuts, and did not appreciate
the gift. The basket travelled over as usual with their
dinner, but carried no acknowledgment of the pea-nuts.
In the afternoon Lieutenant Dane, of the signal corps,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>was seen approaching our lines with a prize—a prize
that had neither predecessor nor successor—a leg of
mutton. The lieutenant delivered the mutton across
the line to one of us, and the notability of the event
warranted him in saying before the guard:</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is a present from Major Barnes. Did you get
the pea-nuts we sent you this morning?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, yes,” responded Captain Dillingham, on behalf
of our mess; “yes, they’re very nice. We are much
obliged to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Eat them,” said the lieutenant, “eat them. They
won’t hurt you—eat them all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Captain carried the leg of mutton in, and hurriedly
took down the pea-nuts. We looked sharply at
them, but saw nothing unusual. Why eat them <i>all</i>?
“If they want us to do so, it must be done!” We proceeded
to break the shells. Presently there was a shell—a
sound and healthy shell—within which had grown a
long, narrow slip of paper, rolled up tightly. It contained
a single message, viz., that the covered handle of
Mr. Fowler’s basket was in fact a mail-bag. From that
time on, the watchful patrols would lift out the plates,
and inspect the beef, and scrutinize the dodger, and then
carry the mail-bag backward and forward for us.</p>

<p class='c011'>With the increased number of prisoners, there had
been a change in the command of the camp. The company
of volunteers were relieved by a battalion of
militia. To our surprise, the militia very far surpassed
the volunteers, and did their business in a very soldierly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>way. The battalion was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel
John Sayles, a lawyer of considerable distinction
in Texas. The Lieutenant-Colonel was a man of few
words, very quiet, very kind, and rarely gave an order
that did not effect an improvement.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the Sunday after he assumed command, Colonel
Sayles informed me in his quiet way, that there would
be Divine service in the grove, and invited me and all
the prisoners to accompany him. There had been a
reverend gentleman preaching at Camp Groce the Sunday
before I arrived, who had been seeking a chaplaincy,
and had assumed what he supposed was a popular train
of argument; as for instance, warning his beloved
brethren that the chief horror of eternal punishment
would be meeting the President of the United States
there. I do not care to hear irreverent things said in the
pulpit, nor do I think it the part of an officer to listen
voluntarily to denunciations of his government, yet I
felt assured that Colonel Sayles would not invite me to
anything of that kind, and I thought I could best acknowledge
his civility by accepting.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the clergyman who officiated first caught sight
of the prisoners, forming one-half of his audience, he
evinced a little embarrassment. He alluded to this as
he began his sermon, and spoke happily of the breadth
of the Christian faith, extending to all conditions of men,
and enabling enemies to stand together and worship at
one altar. His prayer was chiefly an affecting and
beautiful petition on our behalf. He spoke of the tender
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>ties that were severed, and besought consolation for our
distant dear ones, who must be now in anxiety watching
our fate. He prayed, too, that “we their captors and
keepers, may have grace to treat them as becomes
Christian soldiers, resisting the evil passions of our
hearts and the evil counsels of wicked and cruel men.”</p>

<p class='c011'>After the services were concluded, we were introduced
to the clergyman, Mr. McGown, of Huntsville. He
visited us in our quarters, ministered to our sick, and
was always one of our most welcome visitors. He had
been with Houston in the war of Texan independence,
and was one of the heroes of San Jacinto. His acquaintance
with the General had been intimate, and he entertained
us with many interesting anecdotes of him and
tales of the former war.</p>

<p class='c011'>These anecdotes of General Houston then possessed
for us unusual interest. When some of the older prisoners
had been sent to the State Prison at Huntsville, they
were halted a few minutes on the outskirts of the
town. As they waited there, a tall, imposing old man
approached and asked, who was the United States officer
highest in rank. Captain Dillingham was pointed out
to him as the senior naval officer. Walking up to him
and extending his hand, he said, in a deep, emphatic
voice, “My name is Houston, sir. I have come to say
to you, gentlemen, that I do not approve of such treatment
for prisoners of war. No prisoner of war shall ever
be put in a jail with my consent.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The death of General Houston occurred just before I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>reached Texas. Many stories were told of his great personal
power, and strange incidents of his wondrously
romantic life. The forebodings of his celebrated letter
were all realized before he died, for his oldest son was
in the ranks—his warmest friends and supporters were
scattered and slain, and ruin and desolation brooded over
the State which he had established and so long directed
and controlled. He was guarded in the expression of
his political sentiments, but occasionally addressed the
troops, speaking from the <i>Texan</i> point of view. He
never took the oath of allegiance to the Confederate
Government. A short time before his death travellers
were required to have a Provost Marshal’s pass, and to
procure a pass they must take the oath. The General
had neither taken the oath nor procured a pass. He
set out, however, on a journey and proceeded till one of
the provost guard halted him and demanded his pass.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My pass through Texas,” said the old man, in his
sternest tone, “is San Jacinto.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Texan soldier looked at him for a moment. “I
reckon,” he said, “<i>that</i> pass will go as far in Texas as
any a Provost Marshal ever wrote. Pass an old San
Jacinto.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Colonel Sayles was soon succeeded by Major James S.
Barnes of the same battalion. The Major was a Georgian
by birth, an old Texan by residence, and a man of
great general information, and so far as we were concerned,
in every thought and word and deed a perfect
Christian gentleman.  He told stories with a graphic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>simplicity I have never heard excelled, and was so pleasantly
reasonable and so enticingly good-natured that
even our wayward sailors consented to be led by a landsman,
and allowed that he was as good a man as a rebel
could be. One day as the Major passed through the
barracks chatting with the well and cheering up the sick,
he hinted at the uncertainty of exchange and at coming
“northers,” and advised us to prepare for the worst by
building ourselves chimneys and fire-places. He promised
to provide an old negro chimney-builder to engineer
the work and teams to haul the material. The dwellers
in the shanty quickly availed themselves of the offer.
But nothing could induce those in the barracks to go
and do likewise. So weak and dispirited were all that
the difficulties appeared insurmountable. When the
frost came and found them still prisoners, they piled
sand on the floor, and making fire upon it sat there and
shivered, while the smoke floated over them and found
its way out through the holes in the roof.</p>

<p class='c011'>We, who were wise betimes, cut our logs in the woods,
dug up our clay on the neighboring hill-side, and waited
the arrival of “Uncle George.” This uncle came in
time, and led the work. A hole was cut in Mr. Stratford’s
room—the logs were notched and crossed, the
chimney splints were split and laid up, and the whole
was properly cemented together, and daubed over with
rich clay mortar.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hardly was the chimney complete, when one of the
guard announced that he reckoned there’d be a norther;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>the beeves, he said, were making for the timber. In
Texas it is an established fact that nobody can tell anything
about the weather, so we gave little heed to the
prediction. Early in the afternoon, however, some one
said that the norther was in sight. The day was warm;
the sun was bright; birds were singing, and the leaves
still were green. There was nothing to indicate a change
save a black cloud rapidly rising in the north. Our
men were sitting round in their shirt-sleeves, whittling
and working as usual, and every thing continued pleasant.
The black cloud, however, bore swiftly down upon
us. As it drew near, we saw an immense flock of turkey-buzzards
driven before it, whirling in the air and screaming
wildly. A moment later the breeze struck us. It
felt not unlike the gust that precedes a thunder-shower,
but as I watched the cloud I found that I had suddenly
grown cold. I had heard fearful stories of these northers,
and read of a hardy Vermonter, who, scorning a cold
that merely skimmed the ponds with ice, had ventured
out in one; and how his blood congealed, and he was
carried back by his horse insensible. I saw that all
the men had gone in, and that the sentries had wrapped
themselves in their blankets. Within the shanty I
found our little fire-place bright and its owners sitting
in a close circle around it. But the cold seemed to beat
directly through the walls, and the wind blew a steady
blast. We passed all the long evening closely crouched
around the fire, warming first one side and then the
other, talking of home and pitying the poor wretches in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>the barracks. When bed-time came we carried hot
stones with us into our bunks and hurried to bed before
we should be chilled. I wrapped myself in my double
army blanket with which I had braved ice and snow
and then rolled myself in my buffalo. I thought it sufficient
for an Arctic winter, but ere morning the horrible
cold crept in and penetrated to the very bones. As I
moved about to try and make my blood circulate,
Colonel Burrill spoke and said that he was so cold that
he feared he was dying. The Colonel had been quite
ill, and this startled me; so I rose, threw a coat or two
upon him, and then drawing the blankets over his head,
tucked them tightly in and left him to take the chances
of suffocation or freezing. I went back to my own
couch and shivered away till morning. The cold drove
us all out early, and we met again around our fire-place.
A sailor boy brought up a hot breakfast, for cooking over
a hot stove that morning was a high privilege which no
one threw away. He told us that one of his shipmates
lay frozen in his bunk, and that they had just found him
there dead. During the morning we suspended our
blankets from the rafters so as to form a little tent immediately
around the fire, and there in darkness we sat
the live-long day. Another dismal evening followed
and another bitter night. Then, after thirty-six hours of
fury, the norther went down and we ventured to crawl
out and resume our work.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>VII.<br /> <span class='large'>TEA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>There was some coffee in Camp Groce, when we
arrived—not much—and a little was bought afterward
for “morning coffee,” with some tea for the sick, at fifteen
dollars per pound. It was poor stuff, and not worth
the price.</p>

<p class='c011'>The messes that I found there used corn; or, as they
called it, corn coffee. This was made from the meal.
Burnt in a frying-pan upon the stove, by a sailor-cook,
some particles in charcoal and some not singed at all, it
formed a grayish compound, and made as horrible a
beverage as any one could be supposed willing to drink.
I thought at first that I would go back, for my own part,
to an old habit of cold water; and if we had possessed
pure water I might have done so. But our well-water
had a sulphurous taste; and then, in this southern climate,
there is an insatiable appetite for nervine food.
Thus those who never touched pepper, nor cared a fig for
seasoning, and spices at home (not because they disliked
them, but because they thought it wisest not to eat what
they did not want), have had a constant craving in the
army for coffee, tea, and spices, and for the bad catsups,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>and worse imitation sauces, that sutlers sell and soldiers
buy. So I drank these slops, and, like the others, called
them coffee.</p>

<p class='c011'>A little mess, indeed, as I have hinted, applied the
Louisiana lesson we had learnt, and made their “morning
coffee.” Turning out with the first glimmer of dawn,
we ground and re-ground exactly twenty of the precious
berries, watchful that not one should be lost, nor a speck
of the priceless dust spilt. An old tin cylinder, with a
piece of flannel bound tightly round the end, formed the
strainer, and a large-sized tin mug our coffee-pot; and by
keeping a week’s grounds, at least, in the strainer, it was
wonderful what strength this ingenious apparatus did
extract.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the enterprising Yankee mind, never long contented
with any thing, quarrelled with the corn-meal
coffee and proposed a change. A hardy sailor, of New
England origin, objected to the <i>meal</i>, and insisted that
it would be better to make the coffee directly out of
corn—we should, he said, get all the flavor then. There
was a furious debate over this, of course, for the enterprising
Yankee mind much prefers a theory to a fact.
It was argued on the one side, that the flavor was just
what you did not want; that corn was corn, and it made
no difference if it was also meal; and that it was much
wiser to use the meal and thereby make the enemy
grind our coffee, than to burn the corn and grind it ourselves.
These arguments were met by others equally
strong, and the debate continued till some stupid person
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>of Dutch descent, suggested that the proof of the pudding
is in the eating, and that if any one wanted to try
corn for coffee, he might.</p>

<p class='c011'>We traded some of our meal ration for corn; the corn
was burnt and ground and tried, and found far preferable
to meal and all other substitutes. Its opponents
drank it, and our little coffee-mill creaked and rattled
at all hours under the load which the discovery threw
upon it.</p>

<p class='c011'>A further improvement was effected, for it was discovered
one day, that the outside of the kernel would be
well parched, while the inside would have a yellow, undone
appearance. The fact is, it was impossible to roast
it through, and this gave to the coffee a raw, mealy
taste. The remedy was simple, and consisted merely in
not grinding the corn, and thus using only the outside of
the kernel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We thought then that we had reached the perfection
of corn, and the last of substitutes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was, however, a tea made by the Texans from
the leaves of a half bush, half tree, called <i>yapon</i>, which
was said to taste wonderfully like the real. They drank
it three times a day, at Captain Buster’s head-quarters,
and many of the sailors followed the fashion. Yet it had
a bad name. It was said, that it caused certain unpleasant
medical effects, and one young gentleman, who had
once taken a mug full, averred that he shortly thereafter
felt a burning sensation in that part of his body where
he supposed (erroneously) was his stomach.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>I never could find the men whom it was said to have
made sick, and I had little belief in the rumor. Yet, as I
do not like tea except when ill, there was little inducement
to experiment with this unknown, untried plant.
Still I meant to test it, some time or other, as a matter
of scientific curiosity, and if it were like the Chinese
plant, to carry a handful home for the edification of tea
drinkers there.</p>

<p class='c011'>This “some time or other” did not come, probably because
the material was always close at hand. The
yapon grew thickly along the brook and up to the borders
of the camp. It was generally from ten to twenty
feet high, and as thick as a man’s arm; it had furnished
us with nearly all the poles for a rustic arbor,
that ran along the sunny side of the barracks, and helped
to shade and cool the sick-bunks. Its branches, too,
had been used to fill up in roofing the arbor, and there
were leaves enough there to furnish an army with
bohea.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus time glided away under the influence of corn
coffee, till one day it was said, that the commanding
officer had proclaimed corn coffee unhealthy, nay, dangerous.
There were then numerous medical symptoms,
all pointing forward to intermittent fever and backward
to corn coffee. When a dozen men compare notes, and
find that they are all afflicted in the same way, and
never in their lives have been so before, it alarms
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The surgeon was informed of this, and he thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>there must be something in it, the intermittent cases had
increased so unaccountably. As we thus deliberated,
Colonel Sayles came up and we consulted him. The
Colonel gave his facts and recommended sweet potatoes
as a substitute for corn and coffee.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let us look at the analysis,” said the surgeon, walking
into his office and taking down a big book.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Corn or maize, sometimes called Indian corn. This
grain is cultivated throughout the United States.’”
“Yes, we know that.” “‘Its analysis shows starch,
sugar, <i>sulphate of lime</i>.’ That must be the agent (if any)
which is doing us all the damage. I really think you had
better follow the Colonel’s advice and take up the sweet
potatoes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let us see what the potato has in it. Doctor, who
knows but that there’s some other atom to be roasted
into poison there?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Batata, yes, ‘batata, or common potato,’ ‘seed poisonous,’
and so forth. Analysis sugar, and so forth. It
has the sulphate again and more of it than there is in
corn. That will never do, to say nothing of costing
ten dollars a bushel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>October was drawing toward its end when there came
a “wet norther,” and with it a sharp frost, ice thick as
a pane of glass—much suffering—some agues and countless
colds.</p>

<p class='c011'>The “norther” found me ill with a periodical return of
my Louisiana malarial, and brought me a cold of the
severest kind. It blew through the cracks and crannies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>of the barracks, through my blankets and through me.
I felt as though my blood had ceased to circulate and I
should never be warm again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Try some of Mr. Fowler’s sumach,” suggested some
one; “it cured my cold.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have tried everything,” I said, “and find the only
thing is prevention—nothing cures these colds with me
when they have come.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I never got any help from medicine,” said my
friend. “But this stuff of Fowler’s cured mine in a
night. I never knew any thing like it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I went to Mr. Fowler and got the sumach berries. A
cluster or two thrown in a quart mug of boiling water
made the remedy. It was fearfully acid, and it took
fearful quantities of sugar to make it palatable, but it
then had quite a pleasant taste and worked (let me say
for the benefit of the victims of violent catarrh) a miraculous
cure.</p>

<p class='c011'>I had not paid much attention to the Acting Master’s
simples, having no great faith in medicine and less in
herbs—but this with the dread of another bilious attack
aroused me so far that I walked round the barracks and
asked after the livers of all the patients who had been
treated with his wild peach bark. These livers were
found to be in a highly improved condition, and thinking
it fair that mine should have a share in all the medical
advantages afforded by a residence in Texas, I determined
to treat it also to wild peach bark.</p>

<p class='c011'>The “norther” broke on the second day, and in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>after noon the weather was much like the last part of
one of our cold nor’-easters. The rain had ceased, but the
clouds floated gloomily overhead and the wind blew
coldly from the north.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, Stratford,” I said, “I am a convert to the
Fowler treatment, and shall feel the better for a little
exercise. Let us go out and get some bark.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, it’s too cold and the ground will be muddy; you
had better wait till to-morrow; it will be fine weather
then.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, no, to-morrow you will be at work on the chimney,
and this is a broken day; let us go now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, if you will get the patrol we will go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I walked down to the guard-house and represented to
the sergeant of the guard the importance of having wild
peach bark and the necessity of going out to get it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sergeant first raised the usual difficulties and then
gave the usual order. A stout gentleman, who helped
himself to a double-barrelled gun, informed us that he
would go as Pat Roll. He sketched briefly his life
for us by stating that he was born in South Carolina,
raised in Alabama, druv stage in Florida, and sogered
it in Texas. He also expressed the opinion that Texas
was an easy country to live in, “because the hogs run in
the woods and the horses run out,” and he intimated
that he looked with great contempt on those parts of the
world where the hogs eat corn, and the horses live in the
stable.</p>

<p class='c011'>As I was still weak I handed my axe over to one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>the others. We crossed the brook and near by found a
wild peach. It was soon cut down, and we proceeded
as usual to shave off the bark from the trunk of the tree,
and then pull up such roots as would come. When this
was done each of my companions loaded himself with
an unpeeled log, while I took the axe and basket of bark.
Thus laden, we started to return.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Since we are working for the Herb Department,”
said I, “let us take up some yapon and try the tea. I
wonder if I can cut off this branch with one hand?”</p>

<p class='c011'>A well-leaved branch of the yapon hung over the
road, bright with red berries, and against it I raised the
axe. A couple of blows brought it down. Mr. Stratford
added it to his load, and with it we went back to
our quarters.</p>

<p class='c011'>A day or two passed, during which the weather moderated.
It was Saturday afternoon, and I was sitting in
the sun, still languid, while Mr. Stratford was trying to
heat red-hot an old shovel he had found, in order that
he might cut off its rivets and fit in it a new handle,
when the thought of the yapon came into my head,
I took up the branch and began to pluck off the leaves.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you going to try the yapon?” said Lieutenant
Sherman, who casually came in.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, and I want you to go up to the galley and dry
the leaves.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, why don’t you take them green? That’s the
way the sailors do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“True! but the sailors are not remarkable for skill in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>scientific cookery, and I think a decoction of any green
plant must differ a good deal from that of a dry one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then why don’t you take some of the leaves from
the arbor?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They are all bleached and washed to pieces. A
horse would not eat hay that had been hung up in the
rain and dew as they have. Go into the doctor’s office
and get his Dispensatory, and we will prepare them as the
Chinese do. The book must give the process for tea, for
I was looking at ‘sweet potatoes’ the other day, and
found accidentally that it is very full on the making of
sugar.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The lieutenant brought the book, turned to the article,
and read:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘<span class='sc'>Tea.</span>—The plant which furnishes tea. <i>Thea Chinensis</i>
is an evergreen shrub, belonging to’”——</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind the botany, we do not mean to grow
tea, but cure it. Go over to the manufacture.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He skipped over a page or two and proceeded:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘It is propagated from the seeds. In three years the
plant yields leaves for collection, and in six attains the
height of a man. When from seven to ten years old, it
is cut down, in order that the numerous shoots which
issue from the stumps may afford a large product of
leaves. These are picked separately by the hand. Three
harvests, according to Koempfer, are made during the
year. As the youngest leaves are the best, the product
of the first collection is most valuable, while that of the
third, consisting of the oldest leaves, is comparatively
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>little esteemed. After having been gathered, the leaves
are dried by artificial heat in a shallow iron pan.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s a shovel,” said Mr. Stratford, who generally
manufactured the most of our small-wit, and who had
just come in to take his shovel from the fire. “That’s a
shovel—a shovel is a shallow iron pan.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘From which,’” pursued Lieutenant Sherman, reading,
“‘they are removed while still hot, and rolled with
the fingers on the palm of the hands, to be brought into
the form in which they are found in commerce.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right,” said Mr. Stratford. “You have picked
the leaves separately by the hand. I’ll dry them artificially
by heat in a shallow iron pan, and Sherman can
roll them with the finger or in the palm of his hand, to
bring them into the right shape.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He drew his shovel from the fire as he spoke, and
after knocking off the loose ashes, threw a handful of the
yapon leaves upon it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“These leaves won’t roll up,” said Lieutenant Sherman,
after they had been drying a few minutes on the
shovel. “They crack and unroll themselves.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but they are old leaves, see how thick they are,
and the berries are red and ripe. Here by chance is a
young one; the book says, you know, that they value
the young leaves most. What better shape could you
have than that—just the roll of a tea-leaf.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now,” said Mr. Stratford, “that they are artificially
dried in a shallow iron pan, Sherman, put the
coffee-pot on, and let’s all take tea.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>The turn affairs had taken roused in me rather more
than usual curiosity, and as my mug was filled, I examined
the tea with rather more than customary care. The
aroma was that of poor tea, and the resemblance was
quite striking, making me more curious as to the taste.
I cooled it down as rapidly as possible and took a sip.
There was a woody taste, but through this came the
unmistakable flavor of the tea. “Who knows but this
is a discovery?” I thought, and so I said emphatically:</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>This is</i> <span class='fss'>TEA</span>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is amazingly like it, though not very good.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is the tea-plant itself. Sherman, turn back to the
article and read the botany.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The lieutenant re-opened the book and again read.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘The plant which furnishes tea, <i>Thea Chinensis</i>, is
an evergreen shrub.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is an evergreen shrub. See how bright the
leaves are, though we are near November.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Belonging to the class and order <i>Monadelphia
Polyandria</i>, of the sexual system, and to the natural
order <i>Ternstromiaceæ</i>.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think this is Poly—what do you call it?” said Mr.
Stratford, encouragingly; “and I’m sure it belongs to
the natural order.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘It is usually from four to eight feet high, though
capable, in a favorable situation, of attaining the height
of thirty feet.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Texas is a favorable situation,” said Lieutenant Sherman.
“I can find one that comes up to thirty feet.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>“‘It has numerous alternate branches.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So has the yapon, alternate and plenty of them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Furnished with elliptical-oblong or lanceolate
pointed leaves.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“These are elliptical, oblong and pointed leaves.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Which are serrate, except at the base.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“These are serrate; and let me see, yes, ‘except at
the base.’ Not a saw tooth there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Smooth on both sides, green, shining, marked with
one rib and many transverse veins.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘<i>Smooth on both sides, green, shining, marked with
one rib and many transverse veins</i>’—the exact description.
Do look at them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘And supported alternately upon short foot-stalks.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Supported alternately upon short foot-stalks’—so
they are.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘They are two or three inches long and from half an
inch to an inch in breadth.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“These are little more than half the size. But then
the book is describing the cultivated plant, and this is
the wild one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘The flowers are either solitary or supported two or
three together at the axils of the leaves.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a pity we have not seen the flower!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The berries, though, will help us to place them.
Here they are ‘solitary,’ yes, and ‘two or three together,’
and at ‘the axils of the leaves.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘The fruit is a three-celled, three-seeded capsule.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“This has four, but I think that is not material. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>persimmons, for instance, have seven seeds here and only
two or three in New Jersey.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That,” said Mr. Stratford, still encouragingly, “is
because Texas is such a seedy place. I’ve grown somewhat
seedy myself since I’ve been here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘It is stated that the odor of the tea-leaves themselves
is very slight.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The odor of these is <i>very</i> slight,” remarked Mr. Stratford,
“so slight, that I sometimes imagine I don’t smell
it at all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘And that it is customary to mix with them the
leaves of certain aromatic plants, such as <i>Olea Fragrans</i>.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When the war is over,” said Mr. Stratford, in conclusion,
“we will get some olea to mix with it, and then
it will be all complete. And now let us hurrah for the
great American tea. You can stay here and take care
of the plant, and I will go home (so soon as I can) and
get up a great Texan Tea Company.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>VIII.<br /> <span class='large'>CAMP FORD.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Autumn was drawing to a close, the leaves had fallen
from the trees, the grass was no longer green, and
prairie and timber seemed alike bare and cold. Still no
exchange had come. We knew of the thirty-seven thousand
prisoners taken at Vicksburg, and the six thousand
taken at Port Hudson, and therefore we listened hopefully
to rumors of exchange, and coined a few of our
own, and remained prisoners of war.</p>

<p class='c011'>Within the prison-camp, affairs had not grown brighter.
There was increased sickness with despondency and (for
so small a party) many deaths. Two Massachusetts
officers had died early. Then the consumptive lieutenant’s
light had flickered, and with fitful changes grown
more and more dim, until it softly expired. A week
later, as some of us were awaiting impatiently the
breakfast-whistle of our cook, an officer ran hurriedly
past to the guard-line, and calling to the surgeon,
said, “Come quickly, Doctor, Lieutenant Hayes is
dead!” The merry-hearted Irishman lay in his hammock
in the composure of an easy sleep. His light had
gone out in a single instant. Later, our friend, Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>Parce, grew weaker. An order came to send the “citizen
prisoners” to Mexico; it did not revive him. His
strength waned, but his placid cheerfulness was still undisturbed.
“It is a bad sign,” said one of his friends,
“if he were only cross and fretful, we might hope.”
The sign did not pass away; and with the prospect of
home and liberty held before him he died. We knew that
at this rate, another year would leave very few survivors
to be carried from the camp.</p>

<p class='c011'>One gloomy evening, as we sat pondering and talking
over our affairs, rumor came in and told us a new tale.
It said that the prisoners were to be <i>paroled</i> and sent
forthwith to the Federal lines. The rumor was confirmed
within a day or two by Major Barnes; but when the
paroling officer came, it appeared that it was not altogether
true; the seamen and privates were to be paroled;
the officers were to be sent to Camp Ford.</p>

<p class='c011'>It behooved us now to find ways and means for carrying
our remaining effects to their new abode. By the
aid of Major Barnes we succeeded in chartering two
wagons for fifteen hundred dollars. We also secured an
old hack to carry Mrs. Stratford and four sick officers at
fifty dollars apiece. Some of us strove hard to purchase
a poor horse or cheap pony that would carry us at any
gait. In this race honor compels me to confess that the
effrontery of the navy completely distanced the army.
Early one morning the camp rang with cries of “Here’s
yer mule.” Through the admiring throng appeared an
animal of that description towed in by Captain Dillingham.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>It was a peculiar animal—small, old, ugly, vicious,
and one-eyed. The Captain had bought him on our
joint account, and had paid for him one hundred and
fifty dollars in the currency of the Confederate States of
North America. This alarmingly low price was due to
the recent loss of his left optic, causing a dangerous sore,
which, the vendor thought, would not prove fatal before
we reached Camp Ford. The example was speedily
followed by Captain Crocker of the “Clifton,” who bought
another mule, and by Captain Johnson of the “Sachem,”
who bought a third, and by Surgeon Sherfy of the
“Morning Light,” who bought an old “calico” horse that
the sailors immediately named “Quinine.” The army,
either from excess of modesty or excess of poverty, did
not succeed, I regret to say, in buying anything.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can we ride there on a mule bare-back?” was the
question. “Decidedly not,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet a good saddle in Texas would cost as much as a
good horse. In this state of doubt we were relieved by
purchasing of a contraband an old wooden “tree” with
a strap or two and a piece of raw-hide hanging to it. It
bore about the same relation to a saddle that a pair of
old wheels do to a cart. But we went to work. And
here again the army was eclipsed by the navy. I had
been a cavalry officer, and thought I knew a thing or
two about broken saddles, and accounted myself fertile
in such expedients, but the Captain borrowed a sailor’s
needle and palm-thimble; brought out an old marlin-spike
and some rope, and stitched and spliced with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>neatness and rapidity that threw me in the shade. Trunk
straps were speedily transferred and changed into girths,
some rope was spliced and lashed around a wooden shoe
till it became a stirrup, and pieces of raw-hide were
bound to the “tree” till it fairly grew to be a saddle.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the time of departure approached another subject
engrossed our attention. Eating continued to be the
chief thought and passion of our lives. Whatever could
be bought to eat we bought. Our stoves ran literally
night and day in baking hard-tack; and we, duly instructed
by a professional cracker-baker, pounded dough
till our arms ached.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was still another subject of interest to many.
A large part of the officers belonged either to the navy
or to new regiments. They were entirely innocent of
having slept out a night in their lives, and knew nothing
of marches and bivouacs. The fuss which they made
about this expected movement was in the highest degree
amusing to those who, by virtue of a year or two’s service,
dubbed themselves veterans. <i>They</i> looked on with
smiles as they saw the others making good blankets into
poor shelter-tents, and winked to each other when they
heard the new men confidently assure one another that
they could stand it now, even if there should be a wet
night upon the march.</p>

<p class='c011'>After some delay there came in five or six impressed
wagons and a squadron of stalwart men mounted on
large, well-fed horses. They were chiefly stock breeders
from the prairies, and boasted of being the best mounted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>troop in Texas. All of these men owned the horses they
rode, and many brought with them a led horse and servant.
They were supposed to be men of unquestionable
secession sentiments, and were employed chiefly in hunting
down conscripts and guarding prisoners.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the ninth of December our seamen and privates
left us, and we were notified to be ready on the eleventh.
Our two wagons came down—a quantity of yapon was
gathered and dried—a last baking of biscuit was made,
and our stoves were duly incased in open boxes with
beckets so as to be readily loaded and unloaded.</p>

<p class='c011'>A move is always interesting; after months of dreary
idleness it is exciting. Happy did we seem, and happy
did we feel as on the cold, foggy morning we marched
down the “wood road,” crossed the little brook, and left
Camp Groce at last behind us. The new Captain—a
tall, powerful Texan, with a determined eye and stern,
compressed lips—evidently understood his business. He
kept us well together, managed his own men with few
words and great judgment, and watched the column
with close vigilance. The one-eyed mule behaved with
gravity and decorum, never showing any unnecessary
signs of life or unseemly gayety, except once when he
slipped his bridle and ran away like a deer.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before three o’clock we went into camp on a little
brook called “Kane’s Creek.” Thanks to the autumn
rains, there was some water in the “creek,” and thanks
to the December frosts, it was clear and cold. The proceedings
of our naval friends were a new chapter in my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>experience of bivouacs. Notwithstanding the clear sky
and roaring camp-fires, edifices called shelter-tents were
erected, with an immense amount of consultation and
anxiety. Heavy mattresses were unpacked from the
wagons and lugged to the tents. Stoves were unloaded
and put up under trees, where they soon smoked and
steamed as did the excited cooks who hovered around
them. So elaborate, indeed, was the dinner of our
mess, that the short winter day closed ere Lieutenant
Dane doffed his apron, and summoned us to our seats
around the camp-fire. By its light I saw a sirloin of
roast beef, a large piece of corned, sweet potatoes, corn
bread and butter, flap-jacks and sauce, tea, coffee and
cake.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What are you doing?” asked somebody, as I drew
out my pencil and note-book. “I thought you never
took notes; it was only an hour ago you were telling
me that a note-book spoils a good traveller.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am noting down this bill of fare. After my rough
experience in our army of the West, this dinner seems
too ridiculous to be believed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I suppose you will publish it in the newspapers
when you get out?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I rather think I shall.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, it’s the last of the pepper,” said the caterer,
“so mind and put it down.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, by all means.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And they say we can buy no sugar at Tyler,” said
another; “so mind and put <i>it</i> down.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Certainly; anything else?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>“There’s some salt, and there’s a hard-tack. Perhaps
you think they are luxuries. And here’s a candle,
moulded in the neck of a bottle—hadn’t you better mention
it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think I had—the mould was so ingenious. You
remember I invented it myself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You haven’t exposed the fact that it’s our last pound
of coffee, treasured up for this journey?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Certainly not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nor that the tea grew in Texas?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t—a few such secrets exposed will destroy the
whole effect of the bill. And now, if the dinner isn’t
too much for you, let us box up the stove, while those
delicate young gentlemen wash the dishes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So we boxed up the stove, and washed the dishes, and
lit our pipes, and sat looking in the glowing camp-fire.
And then our three naval Captains crawled into a tight
little shelter-tent, where they suffocated and perspired,
and caught cold. The army part of the mess spread
their blankets and lay down, with their feet against a
smoking log, their heads resting on their knapsacks, and
their eyes watching the stars, which twinkled them
asleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>The bugle called us long before daylight to prepare
our breakfast and re-load the wagons. I cannot pay
Captain Davis a better compliment, than by saying that
for five successive mornings we moved off at precisely
6–45, and then for six successive mornings at precisely
seven. This day the road ran over some fine rolling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>country, occasionally clean and park-like, with stately
trees sprinkled here and there, and entirely free from
young wood and underbrush. The weather was delightful,
but we went into camp before two o’clock, after a
march of only fourteen miles.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next morning as we started, a cold gust of north
wind struck us. It was not a “norther,” but a sudden
change of weather from warm to cold. All the morning
we breasted it, and it blew keener and keener as the day
advanced. Early in the afternoon we encamped in an
open wood, which gave but poor shelter from the piercing
gale. The little stream that formed our watering
place was coated with ice, and the ice grew thicker with
each hour. We set ourselves at the work of unloading
the wagons and the heavier work of chopping wood for
the large camp-fire that must burn all night. The stove
went up and puffed and steamed as usual, and all
endeavored to impress upon the mind of our amateur
<i>chef</i> that this extreme cold was only an additional reason
that we should eat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“While we were fresh from a sharp walk, with the
blood stirred by the active labors of the camp, we were
comfortable enough. When we first threw ourselves
down before the fire all aglow, saying we were thankful
that the work was done, we still felt indifferent
to the cold north wind. But presently it crept in, and
sent a shivering chill over the frame. Then the nervous
energy relaxed, and one felt great need of a warm room
where he could hide himself from the blast, and fall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>asleep if only for an hour. The dinner and the hot tea
that accompanied it braced us up somewhat, and fitted
us for bed. Our three naval friends again crawled into
their shelter-tent, where (inasmuch as it was at a prudent
distance from the fire) they nearly froze to death.
The remainder of the mess used the shelter-tent, a large
tree and the stove box as a wind-break, and put their
feet almost in the fire. For some hours we all slept
soundly, as men must who have marched and worked
since long before day. But although the blankets were
drawn over our heads and the wind-break seemed to
afford ample protection, the cutting air pushed its way
in. It crawled through the hair and curled itself round
the neck, and sent the same shivery chills over the body.
I rose and warmed myself by rolling a couple of large
logs on the fire, and prizing them into their places. The
scene around me was wild in the extreme, for every
mess had built a large fire, and the flames of these
leaped and roared in the blast, and sent large sparks
flying through the tree-tops; while in the fiery light,
picturesque figures could be seen crouching over the
embers or throwing fresh wood into the flames.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The bugle again called us up, while the stars were yet
shining, to find the dodger we had baked over night, and
the cold beef we had put by for breakfast, frozen harder
than paving stones. Close seated by the fire, we ate a
moody breakfast, each one declaring that he had not
slept one hour during the night, and that he wanted to
turn in again. Instead of doing so, we took the road,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>now solid as a rock. The horses had to stamp through
the ice to drink, and the “Sunny South” seemed frozen
hard as the hills of the Adirondack.</p>

<p class='c011'>Passing through Huntsville, we found ourselves upon
a sandy road, and travelling through dull woods, whose
weary sameness lasted with hardly an interruption for
one hundred and fifty miles. Toward evening we
encamped beside a deep ravine. The clouds gathered
darkly overhead, and the rain began to fall. It bore all
the appearances of one of our cold November storms,
and we anticipated a tempestuous night. But then
came one of the phenomena of the Texan climate. With
darkness the rain stopped; and the stars seemed to disperse
the clouds. But with daylight the clouds returned,
and as we re-commenced the march, the rain came down
heavily. The matter was made worse by our immediately
descending to the “Trinity bottom,” a rich,
alluvial plain, three miles in width, composed of the
greasiest of mud. When we had dragged ourselves
across this, we were suddenly stopped by the Trinity,
a narrow stream, deep channelled between precipitous
clay banks. A road was cut down each bank, and the
usual scow and rope-ferry appeared at the bottom. The
prisoners who first arrived on foot were immediately
carried over. They scrambled up the opposite bank and
instantly made a fire, around which they closely huddled.
As the wagons arrived, they were hurried
aboard of the scow, for every moment made matters
worse. A crowd of men surrounded each wagon as it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>landed, pushing, pulling, yelling, and in various ways
“encouraging the mules.” Those extraordinary animals
pulled and strained and slipped; now down, now up
again, exhausted, and then renewing their efforts, until
slowly and inch by inch every wagon was carried to
the top of the bank. The scow covered with mules and
white-topped wagons, the struggling teams, the shouting
men, the howling of the wind, the beating of the
rain, all made up a romantic picture. But the toil we
paid for it was extreme, and the crossing of this narrow
river cost us two hours of time.</p>

<p class='c011'>We stopped at two houses after crossing, to make some
purchases. At the first, the lady of the house (a rather
stout female, with a coarse voice and red face) had lost
neither children nor relatives in the war, but nevertheless
cherished a holy hatred of Yankees. When she
learnt that we were of that despised race, and had come
into her house to buy something, her wrath became terrific.
It even overpowered the irresistible effrontery of
the navy. Two of our Captains, who between them had
never failed to win the Texan fair, assayed her, but the
humor of the one and the blandishments of the other
were sent spinning about their ears. “Josiah,” she
said to her abashed husband, while she quivered with
rage, “don’t sell them anything, the nasty beasts, I
didn’t know I hated them so. Don’t sell the beasts a
thing. Corn-meal is too good for them.” He, poor
man, said “no,” but when our two naval commissaries
got him alone, they made mince-meat of his scruples in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>no time. He hurriedly shovelled a bushel of potatoes
into their bag, received his five dollars, and begged them
to leave by the side door, as most convenient and least
exposed to observation.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the other of these houses, the woman had lost two
sons in battle. When she learnt that some of her visitors
were enemies and prisoners, she only hastened to express
her pity. She spread her simple board with all that her
larder contained, and made them sit down. Of some
little articles, such as milk and butter and eggs, she literally
gave them all she had. Other things that they
wished to purchase, she sold—she offered to give, but
they forced the money upon her. And when they rose
to go, she expressed again her sympathy, and hoped that
God would be with them, and comfort them, and send
them deliverance.</p>

<p class='c011'>When we were fairly across the river, and well
drenched, the rain stopped, and the freezing north wind
began to blow. Colder and colder it grew; and when
we passed from the woods to the last prairie we were to
see, we had to face a gale. We struggled against this
for miles, until, late in the afternoon, there appeared, on
the other side of the plain, a little stage-house, and beyond
it timber of scraggly trees, small and scattered. It
was a poor place to bivouac, but the scarcity of water
in this arid country leaves travellers little choice of
camping grounds. We halted, therefore, in this bleak
spot, and speedily came to the conclusion, that it would
be “the coldest night yet.” The stove was unloaded as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>usual, and “put up;” its pipe, lashed to a sapling to keep
it from blowing away, and some stove wood chopped.
Our indefatigable <i>chef</i> then assumed command, and,
despite wind and cold, proceeded to roast a lovely loin
of delicate pork, purchased of the good woman of the
morning, and to serve it up at the proper time with delicious
brown crackling and entrancing hot gravy. Before
that rapturous moment came there was much work
to be done. The wood had to be dragged some distance,
for the trees were sparse, and on such a night the fire
must be fed with no sparing hand. The water had to be
carried, and it was a half-mile distant and at the bottom
of a well two hundred feet deep. A tedious job was
this, and one that seemed as though it would never end.
The pails, the tea-kettle and the iron-pot were all mustered
and carried to the well, but others were there before
us, and we had to wait our turn. Very slowly the
bucket came creeping up while we stood shivering in the
wind, and when it appeared it was half empty, and a
dozen pails were waiting to be filled before the first of
ours. At last when tea-kettle, pot and pails were full,
and we were nearly perished, we picked them up and
navigated them through the thick brush-wood and
against the bitter wind till the ungloved hands were
nearly frozen to the iron handles, and the stiff arms
ready to drop off. Then, too, our <i>chef</i>, like all great
artists in that most useful art, was cross, and asked indignantly
why we had not come back sooner—if it was
so pleasant down at that well that we must stay there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>all day—if we did not know that nothing could be done
without water—if we could not understand that the
lovely loin of pork was well-nigh spoilt already. We,
who were hewers of wood and drawers of water, bore all
this meekly and explained. Our <i>chef</i>, though an amateur,
was about as reasonable as an accomplished female
of the same profession, and would hear no explanation.
He knew that if <i>he</i> had gone <i>he</i> would have found a
way to get it. We secretly expressed to each other
sympathy for scullions, waiters, and other unfortunate
persons having business relations with cooks—we crouched
down by the fire and thawed our frozen fingers—and
then the <i>chef</i> sent us back to the well for more water.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Now spread the night her spangled canopy,</div>
      <div class='line'>And summon’d every restless eye to sleep.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The stove was down and ready to be repacked—the
water pails (refilled) stood close before the fire—the
stove box, the mess-chest and the shelter-tent again were
united for a wind-break—all our night work was done,
and there was no reason why we should not sleep. No
reason but this bitter north wind, before which the flames
of all the surrounding fires leaned down and the sparks
flew level along the ground. And those fires, too, seemed
trivial and feeble; the logs that were piled upon
them were as heavy as two men could lift, yet were not
large enough for such a night as this. Again and again
we woke, aching with the cold; and again and again,
after crouching over the fire, we returned wearily to our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>blankets and sought to steal, ere the reveille, a little
rest.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The purple morning left her crimson bed,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And donn’d her robe of pure vermilion hue,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>In Eden’s flowery gardens gathered new.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>And we resumed the march with blue noses and frosted
beards. The wagons rumbled over the frozen ground
as upon a rock; the horses shivered and shook more
pitiably than their riders. There was unwonted courtesy
amongst us. “Do try my mule a little while.” “No,
I thank you; I could not think of depriving you of him
<i>this</i> morning.” And then the owner, not to be outdone,
would dismount, and run along behind his mule with
much stamping of the feet and beating of the hands.
Comparatively happy then were those wealthy individuals
who owned gloves, or who wore something thicker
than a summer blouse. Yet the biting air wrought its
own cure among the foot passengers and gave them an exhilaration
that beat down its benumbing pain; the thread-bare,
ragged and half-naked crowd, shivering in summer
clothing, uttered no whinings, but bravely pushed along,
rejoicing that broken boots and tattered garments still
held together, and wishing only that they could keep on
against the north wind, till they reached the North.
Less happy were the few who, seated in the old hack,
rode glum and testy with upheaved shoulders and stiff
necks, and mile after mile spoke never a word.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus, after seven hours’ steady marching, we turned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>from the road and went down into a little hollow where
a small rill furnished us with water, and good large trees
with firewood. Here the members of our mess, partly to
make up for the previous night, and partly in the hope
of attaining comfort, built a fire, which (among themselves)
gave to the place the name of the “Camp of the
Big Fire.”</p>

<p class='c011'>We were first on the camping ground, and chose our
tree, a dry oak more than two feet across the stump.
Giving due notice to all that they had better stand from
under, the commander of the “Sachem” swung a strong
axe against it till it fell. The two largest logs were
chopped off, each twelve or fourteen feet long. Skids
were cut and laid, and every man, provided with a stiff
handspike, lifted and strained till the largest log was
raised, “cut round,” rolled, re-rolled and placed against
its own stump as a brace. The skids were then hauled
out and relaid; and the second log was brought opposite
to the first. The skids were next made into an inclined
plane, and we, by stout pushing, rolled the second
log up this bridge until it rested on top of the first. We
then had a solid wooden wall nearly five feet high. In
front we placed huge andirons of logs as thick as a man’s
body. On these we rolled smaller logs, and piled limbs
and small wood until the whole sloped down from the
top of the wall to a line six or seven feet distant from its
base. We worked until the whole tree was in the pile.
Then we set fire to it. It kindled slowly, but burnt
gloriously. There was no rolling out of our blankets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>that night to put wood on the fire. We could feel our
wooden wall throwing its rays down upon us as we lay
before it on the frozen ground. It let no heat pass
through, for while one side was a mass of red-hot embers
the ice had not melted from the other. We slept until
the bugle called us in the morning, and then found
that a little rolling together of half-burnt logs and a
slight shaking up of unfinished brands gave us a splendid
fire to breakfast by.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus we went on, until upon the twelfth day of our
march we passed through the little town of Tyler and approached
Camp Ford. We felt some curiosity as to the
appearance and comfort of this new abode. The question
put to travellers whom we met always brought the
reply that the prisoners were in houses quite comfortable.
In houses prisoners might well be comfortable—much
better to have houses than the dismal barracks of
Camp Groce. At last the road wound round a little
knoll, covered with pine and scraggly oak and disclosed
the camp. We saw on a side-hill a barn-yard of a place,
encompassed by a stockade fence fifteen feet high.
Within, partly burrowed and partly built, was an irregular
group of log shanties, small, dark and dirty. A
naval friend stood at my side, who had been confident
that we should find everything to our liking, and whose
motto was “Nothing is too good for prisoners.” I
glanced at him and saw that, since I last looked, his
countenance had grown immeasurably longer. A lieutenant
of my regiment was on the outside of the stockade
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>waiting to welcome me. He was a young and neat
New-Yorker when I last saw him, but his dress now
consisted of a pair of ragged trowsers and an old woolen
shirt without arms.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What kind of times have you fallen upon, Mr. L?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not very good, Colonel,” he replied, rather dolefully,
and then brightening added, “But we have very good
quarters—<i>at least for prisoners</i>!”</p>

<p class='c011'>My naval friend looked at the lieutenant sternly and
with disgust. He never forgave that speech.</p>

<p class='c011'>The roll was called. We were marched forward. The
gate opened and admitted us to seven months more of
imprisonment. Within every thing looked gloomy and
squalid. My own officers I hardly recognized; the others
bore in their dress and mien the unmistakable marks of
hardship and destitution. A Captain in my regiment
came up, and after the usual greetings invited me into
his “shebang” and to dinner. I walked in and looked
around, I fear with some disgust. A dodger had just
been turned out of its pan and cut up.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can’t stay to dinner, Captain,” I said; “we have a
wagon to unload; but I’ll try a piece of the dodger.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I took a piece and walked out. The gentlemen of the
“shebang” said nothing. But afterward there was a
story told of the affair. It was this:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The dodger was the whole of the dinner.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>IX.<br /> <span class='large'>A DINNER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The prisoners at Camp Ford were poor. They even
thought themselves too poor to borrow. They possessed
no supplies to sell; and in manufactures they had not
risen above carved pipes and chessmen. They lived on
their rations and cooked those rations in the simplest
manner. Half of them had no tables, and more than
half no table furniture. The plates and spoons did
treble duty, travelling about from “shebang” to “shebang”
(as they called the hovels they had built) in
regular succession.</p>

<p class='c011'>We rated them soundly about their condition, and
asked them why they had lived thus; to which they
responded by asking us how they could have lived
otherwise. We lectured them severely on their not having
begged, and above all, on their not having borrowed;
and they answered, meekly, that no one would
lend them. We lent them money, but they received it
timidly, and expressed fears that they would not be
able to re-pay it, and doubts as to whether there was
anything to buy. “Nobody ever had anything to sell,”
they said, “about Tyler.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>A few days had passed in the work of improving our
“shebang,” and we sat one night around the fire
moodily, talking over the state of our affairs. We were
in the midst of the Christmas holidays, and the contrasted
scenes of home pressed rather heavily upon us, and made
the present, perhaps, seem darker than it really was.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Something must be done,” said some one, “to raise
these fellows up. They are completely <i>down</i>, and if we
don’t get them up, why they will pull us down too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never saw such fellows,” said a naval prisoner.
“They could have got clothing from the Confederates just
as easily as we did. Here we come in, thin and pale
and weak, and find them healthy and hearty, and yet all
down in their boots. They don’t seem to have done
anything to keep themselves alive but cook, and not
much of that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>That’s</i> the remedy,” said a third. “You’ve hit it
by accident. ‘<span class='sc'>Cook</span>’ is the word. Let us give a dinner-party
and astonish them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A dinner-party! We <i>should</i> astonish them, so that
we’d never hear the last of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, why not? Didn’t some of us ‘celebrate’ the
Fourth at Brashear? and didn’t we have a Thanksgiving
dinner at Camp Groce? I have great faith in dinners.
Why can’t we have a New Year’s dinner here?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“For the best of all reasons, because there’s nothing
to eat. There we had milk and eggs and potatoes and
onions and a turkey, and——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The turkey was a windfall, and didn’t come till we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>had determined to observe the day, and Dillingham had
issued his proclamation.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And pumpkin and pecan nuts, and beef.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I’m sure we have beef.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, we have, look at the stuff, look at it,” and our
friend pointed to a dark, dry-looking, fatless lump, that
hung from a rafter. “We have got <i>beef</i>, and we have
got flour, and sugar, and bacon, and those are all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Something may turn up if we resolve on it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Something may turn up!’ Yes, it may, and when
it turns up, we’ll give a party.”</p>

<p class='c011'>All agreed to this common sense conclusion, except
two obstinate members of the mess, and they were
Lieutenant Dane, of the signal corps, and myself.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the morrow (the thirtieth of December) we went
to the gate, presented our compliments to the sergeant
of the guard, and informed him that private
business with Colonel Allen, commanding, etc., required
a personal interview. The sergeant communicated the
fact to a gentleman in butternut, who took his rifle and
strolled leisurely over to head-quarters with us. The
Colonel smiled pleasantly, and as he wrote out the pass,
said in a well-bred way, that he never doubted the
honor of his prisoners, though he sometimes had a little
fear of their discretion, and that when he was applied to
by gentlemen who would be discreet in their intercourse
with the country people, it afforded him great
pleasure to let them out on parole.</p>

<p class='c011'>The lieutenant and I returned to our quarters, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>hung around our necks a couple of canteens and three
or four haversacks; we took a basket and bag, received
with gravity sundry bits of ironical advice, and then
presenting to the sergeant of the guard our pass, stepped
out of Camp Ford on parole.</p>

<p class='c011'>The road carried us into the woods. At the end of
half a mile we descended a hill, crossed a little brook,
and found ourselves close upon the white house and
negro-cabins of a plantation. At the door we encountered
a sour-faced, respectable man, with whom we were
soon engaged in the following delightful dialogue:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good day, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you any dried fruit to sell?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No apples?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nor peaches?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Any eggs?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Any chickens?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Couldn’t you spare some potatoes?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing to sell for cash, at the highest of prices?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good day, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good day.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>It was two miles of dull walking to the next house.
A plain-looking old woman appeared and invited us in.
As ill-luck would have it, her two sons had been captured
at Arkansas Post. Still more unluckily, the two
sons, when ill, had been placed in different hospitals,
and some surgeon with petty tyranny had refused to let
the one brother visit the other. We explained that there
were fools in both armies, who treated their own soldiers
in the same way. But the old lady said she would
forgive everything but that. <i>That</i> was unnecessary
cruelty. She then heaped coals of fire upon our unoffending
heads by presenting to us a pumpkin, and by
authorizing her chief contraband, who bore the fruitful
name of “Plenty,” to sell us from his own private stores
a bushel of sweet potatoes. Leaving these treasures till
we should return, we went on.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the third house we had the same conversation over
that we enjoyed at the first, and as we turned back into
the road it began to rain. “Shall we go back or go
on?” was the question. “How far did they say it was to
the next house, two miles?” “Yes, two miles. If we
go on we shall be wet, perhaps frozen. But no matter;
that is better than going back and acknowledging a
failure. Come on.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Three miles more, and we came to another house,
owned by another old lady. Everything about it was
rigidly in order and stiffly neat. There was a startling
combination of colors in her parlor; for the floors were
unpainted, the walls were white, the ceiling blue, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>wainscoting red, and the blinds green. Again we were
told that there was nothing to sell. But luckily, at the
first item on our list, the old lady’s black overseer came
in, and being an intelligent contraband, pricked up his
ears and asked, what the gentlemen wanted to pay for
dried peaches. We inquired what price he asked for
them. He reckoned that he had ’bout a peck, and that
a peck in these times ought to bring $5; and we thought
that $5 was precisely the sum we ought to pay for a
peck of peaches. This purchase being happily effected,
we ran over the list, but to every item our sable friend
“reckoned not,” till we mentioned milk. At that liquid
name, a thought evidently struck him. He hadn’t no
milk, but he had vinegar—cider-vinegar—he made it his
own self, and he reckoned that in these times it ought to
bring $1 a quart. We forthwith entrusted him with
every canteen, to be filled full of this precious, and
indeed, unrivalled fluid. We then re-applied to the old
lady to know whether she really couldn’t sell us <i>something</i>.
But no, not even our free-handed expenditures
and the absence of all Yankee cuteness in us, could
bring forth the old lady’s stores.</p>

<p class='c011'>As we retraced our steps we noticed a small log-house
near the road, and a middle-aged woman barbecuing
beef under a little shed. “Let us try here,” one of us
said; and we went up to the fence and asked for eggs.
The woman thought she had a few, and civilly invited us
to come in out of the rain. We went in, and found that
the house consisted of but one room, and all looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>wretched and forlorn. Nearly a dozen eggs were produced,
and then the woman bethought herself of a certain
fowl that might as well be sold, and set her
eldest boys to catch him. A great cackling presently
announced the fate of the fowl, and the boys, coming
in out of breath, informed us that they had run him
down. He was a vagabond-looking young cock, who,
any one would swear, ought to come to an untimely end,
and I felt a moral pleasure as I tied his legs and popped
him into the basket.</p>

<p class='c011'>And now we had the task of walking six miles back
in the rain. As we mounted a rocky ridge we noticed
near the road some sumach. The sumach had been so
scarce at Camp Groce that we thought this a prize.
Setting down our baskets, therefore, we went to work
picking sumach, and as we filled our haversacks, we
talked of the dinner.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The last haul is a prize, Colonel,” said Lieutenant
Dane. “The vinegar is a treasure, and the peaches are
worth their weight in Confederate notes. How many
shall we ask to dine with us?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, it settles the question of dinner. After such
luck as this we must go on. I think we can squeeze in
six on a side, and one at each end—fourteen in all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fourteen! Well, now, the question is what shall we
have? So far our luck is of a very small pattern—a very
small pattern indeed. Ten eggs and one chicken of
themselves won’t make much of a dinner for fourteen
men.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>“The fact is, we must make this dinner chiefly out of
our own brains. Give it the whole weight of your mind;
think intensely, and see if you can’t hit on a way to make
a dish or two out of chips.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here’s this sumach—what would you make of it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look at it philosophically. Analyse it: <span class='sc'>Taste</span>—<i>acid</i>;
<span class='sc'>Color</span>—<i>red</i>. Now what is there that is acid and
red?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are currants for one thing, and there’s something
else, I’m sure—oh, cranberries.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then we must make currants and cranberries out
of sumach. But for my part I’m greatly distressed
about this wretched fowl—what can we do with him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We might boil him, though he is young and will do
to roast.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What are you thinking of?—one small fowl on a
table before fourteen hungry men; ridiculous!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, and these healthy fellows have got fearful appetites.
They eat like alligators. When they draw
three days’ beef they devour it in one, for fear (as they
say) that somebody might steal it. Can’t you make a
salad of him such as you used to send over to us at
Camp Groce? Do you know when we first came there
we all thought the dressing was real?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let us see—we have vinegar, to be sure, and some
red peppers. But there is not time now to <i>manufacture</i>
the mustard, and then we have no milk or butter to
make the oil from. No! it’s very sad, but we can’t
have chicken salad!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“Well, the haversacks are full, so we may as well go
on. It rains harder than ever, and that low piece of road
will be over our boots in mud and water. I wonder if
we shall find the potatoes and pumpkin all safe?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Our friend “Plenty” duly delivered to us those vegetables
when we reached his cabin. Now, a couple of
officers trudging along in the mud on a rainy day, laden
with a bag of potatoes, a big pumpkin, a couple of overloaded
baskets, and several haversacks and canteens,
cannot present a very elegant or dignified appearance;
nevertheless, a tall man mounted on a ragged-looking
steed, and wearing his head stuck through a hole in the
middle of his blanket, after the fashion of a Mexican
poncha, accosted us as “gentlemen,” and in most courteous
terms desired to know whether this was the road
to Marshall. He gave just one quick, keen glance that
travelled all over us, and rested for a single instant on
our shoulder straps.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I perceive, gentlemen,” said he, without the slightest
diminution of courtesy, “that you belong to the
other side.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I nodded an assent.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And that you are officers?”</p>

<p class='c011'>I nodded again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I presume you are prisoners then, and here on parole?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, wearing a United States uniform at that time in
Texas by no means proved that a man was in the United
States service; it only indicated that he was a soldier.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>So many prisoners were in <i>their</i> butternut, and so many
Confederates in <i>our</i> uniform that a Texan eye rarely
looked behind the coat to distinguish the kind of soldier
it covered. When, therefore, our tall friend said, “You
are on the other side,” and added, “you are officers,” it
was plain to us that he had made the close acquaintance
of our troops in some other way than through the newspapers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I perceive that you are an old soldier,” I said in reply.
“And I do not think you are a Texan. Allow me
to ask where you are from?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I belong to the 1st Missouri Cavalry,” said he,
“and I am from Missouri.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“From Missouri!” I exclaimed. “Why, I was in
service there myself during the first year of the war.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The tall man and I looked steadily at each other in
mutual astonishment. The same thoughts were passing
through our minds, and he expressed them first and best
by saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You know, sir, that if you and I had met this way
in Missouri, that first year of the war, only one of us
would have walked away, and maybe neither.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” I said, “the war was very bitter there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was that. No man could have made me believe
then that I could ever meet an enemy with the same
friendly feelings I have for you, gentlemen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here our friend began to unbuckle his saddle-bags,
and after much trouble produced a flat bottle. “A
friend,” he said, “gave me this, and I mean to carry it
through to Arkansas, if I can, but I must take a drink
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>with a gentleman that was on the other side in Missouri,
the first year of the war, if I never drink again as long
as I live.”</p>

<p class='c011'>We touched our lips to the detestable poison, and
thanked our friend for his courtesy. The “border ruffian”
then expressed his great satisfaction at finding we
were treated as gentlemen and prisoners of war should
be, and said he doubted if he didn’t respect the soldiers
on “the other side” rather more than he did a good
many folks on his own. Finally he asked our names—gave
us his own, which was Woodland—shook hands
warmly, and rode off. We shouldered our loads and
plodded on, wondering whether the barbarous and brutal
trade of war does not of itself inspire men at last with
some noble and chivalric sentiments.</p>

<p class='c011'>These meditations lasted us till we reached the gate.
We were somewhat apprehensive that our appearance
would produce a sensation in camp, and excite anticipations
of the coming festivities, but luckily the rain and
cold had driven all within their hovels. We walked
rapidly past the closed doors of the “shebangs” till we
hastily kicked open our own, and threw down our loads
before the eyes of our astonished messmates. Then after
a savage attack on cold beef and hot dodger, and after
brewing a hot decoction of sumach to keep the cold out,
we hung our wet clothes before the fire, and rolled ourselves
in our warm blankets for the rest of the evening.
Ere we fell asleep some one came in and said that it was
freezing, and that the ground was white with snow.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ground was white with snow, and so were our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>blankets the next morning. The north wind blew a
gale—a goodly sized snow-drift stretched across the floor
of the “shebang”—the water pail was frozen nearly
solid, and a cup of sumach tea that stood upon the table
directly in front of the fire was coated with ice. Daylight
stole in through many chinks and crevices to find
us still shivering in our bunks. One gentleman suggested
that another gentleman rise and cook the breakfast;
but the other gentleman thought the day would be long
enough if we had breakfast any time before sunset. A
humorous man from another “shebang” poked his head
in the door, and inquired whether we would like to be
dug out in the course of the day. We took no notice of
his humor, and shivered in silence. At length the most
uncomfortable one rolled out, threw a pile of logs upon
the fire, and swept away the snow. As a matter of course
the others followed. Breakfast was first disposed of, and
then Lieutenant Dane began his great work. All of
that day we were engaged, like Count Rumford, on a
series of scientific experiments closely allied to the art
of cookery. When night came we had fought our way
over all obstacles, and were able to announce that the
dinner should come off and should be a success.</p>

<p class='c011'>The two junior members of the mess had at the outset
agreed (in bad faith) that if we would cook the dinner,
they would wait upon the table. We now held them to
this agreement, and, as a righteous punishment for their
contempt, determined to cut the dinner up into as many
courses as we decently could, and make them wash the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>plates at the end of every course. The rest of the mess
who had been abashed by our foraging and overawed by
our experiments, became gradually interested, and joined
in the work by inviting the guests, manufacturing a
table, and chopping an immense pile of wood for the
evening.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Happy New Year’s” came to us bright and clear, and
the prisoners followed the old Dutch custom by wandering
around and wishing each other happier returns of the
day. At our “shebang” we were compelled to inform
visitors that we received on the other side of the way.
We were, in fact, busy beyond powers of description,
scolding, as I have observed good cooks always scold,
and ordering in the style that really talented artists
always order. We had three fires in full blast—one
in our fire-place, one in our stove, and one under an
independent pot. I observed, I regret to say, that one
or two of the invited strolled up with a suspicious air, as
if they really feared the invitation might be what the
vulgar term “a sell,” and the dinner so much moonshine.
It was plain that they were not used to being
invited out. As the appointed hour approached, the remarks
of passers-by gradually called our attention to the
fact that this was the coldest day ever known in Texas.
(4° Fahr.) Some extra work was therefore necessary. We
placed the table across the “shebang” directly in front
of the fire-place, and close behind the table, hung blankets
from the roof to the floor, thus curtaining out the cold
after our Camp Groce plan. There were actually found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>crockery plates in camp just sufficient to go round, and
also two naval table-cloths, which spliced, exactly covered
the table. We devoted our last three candles to
illume the festal board; and we built a fire over a backlog
as large as a barrel.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the hour of six o’clock approached our guests were
adroitly intercepted at the door, and carried into a
neighboring cabin, where they were entertained till
wanted. When every thing was ready, the last finishing
touches given, and the two waiters fully instructed
with respect to some strategic movements to be executed
behind a curtain, the door was opened, and our
guests triumphantly marshalled in. As these misguided
men, who for half a year had been devouring
rations off of tin plates, and had not so much as heard
the word table-cloth spoken—as they descended into the
“shebang,” they seemed to be fairly dazed with the
splendors of the apartment. They sank into their designated
seats, too much appalled to speak, and only talked
in subdued tones after three or four courses. The first
course was on the table. It consisted of soup and
wheaten bread—flour bread, as it was vulgarly called in
camp. I observed—at least I had a sort of suspicion—that
one or two of the guests had an habitual idea that
soup was all the dinner; for they looked nervously over
their shoulders when an adroit waiter (with an eye to
the morrow,) whisked the soup off the table immediately
after everybody had been helped <i>once</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>soup</i> plates were removed by one waiter: he disappeared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>with them behind the curtain, and re-appeared
with the dinner-set in about the time the other waiter had
placed the second course upon the table. It might have
been remarked that our soup plates were rather shallow,
and our dinner plates, by contrast, rather deep; but the
eyes of our guests were too dazzled to perceive such
slight peculiarities. We knew that it was a wise maneuvre
to show great profusion at the beginning of a dinner.
The guests then have their anxiety allayed, and carry
with them an overpowering idea of plenty, which of
itself allays the appetite. Accordingly we double shotted
this gun. At the head of the table appeared a dish
not generally known or appreciated. Sweet potatoes
and beef entered largely into its composition. A hungry
naval officer had introduced it into the mess, and he
called it <i>scouse</i>. Yet it served a certain purpose well,
and was skilfully slipped in at this point to attract the
attention of gentlemen with vigorous appetites. At the
other end appeared a broiled spare-rib, and the lines of
communication between these right and left wings were
kept open by detachments of squash, turnips, boiled potatoes,
and <i>cranberry</i> sauce. With secret pleasure we
saw our friends lay in heavily of the scouse, and deceive
themselves into the foolish belief that we had thrown
two courses together, and that this was the dinner.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the next course came on, with clean plates, in the
imposing form and substance of a <span class='sc'>Chicken Pie</span>. A magnificent
chicken pie it was, filling an immense pan, and
richly crowned with brown crust heaving up above the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>brim. It had no accompaniments save baked potatoes,
and constituted of itself an entire army corps. No one
associated with it the idea of anything little, or niggardly,
or economical. On the contrary, all applauded
it enthusiastically, and declared that it alone would have
made a dinner.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the gravity of this heavy dish we passed to the
gayety of mince and pumpkin pies. These were the only
common-place things in the dinner. They were followed
by a course of tarts—small, refined-looking tarts, elegantly
covered with currant jelly and beautiful pear
preserves. This course was surprisingly showy and
genteel, impressing beholders with the idea that there
must be a pastry-cook shop concealed somewhere in the
camp. Our grand climax was one of those efforts of
genius sometimes called “jelly-cake,” sometimes “Lafayette
cake,” sometimes “Washington pie.” It was
some eighteen inches in diameter, and four or five inches
thick, (the exact size of our dodger pot), a beautiful
brown on the outside, and a rich golden yellow within,
and when cut was seen to be divided by strata of tempting
jelly. Finally, we closed with coffee (not corn, but
Java) and tea (not Thea Chinensis, but Thea Texana),
and tobacco inhaled through pipes, instead of through
the original leaf. We broke up, after the usual four
hours’ sitting of a respectable party, with the usual courtesies
and ceremonies. One of two late men stayed, as
they always do, to tell their best stories; and one or two
early men slipped off, as they always do, on the plea of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>domestic engagements. There was one or two small
mishaps, such as a slight infusion of red pepper in the
coffee (occasioned by one of the cooks grinding the pepper
first), and the house getting a-fire (caused by the
stoker piling the wood as high as the log mantel), but
the affair, as a whole, was a grand, noble, philanthropic
success.</p>

<p class='c011'>For the benefit of those persons who (allured by the
brightness of this report) desire to become prisoners, I
will minutely narrate how this wonderful result was
obtained.</p>

<p class='c011'>The soup was <i>real</i>, and probably the strongest thing
of the kind ever made, for a choice assortment of beef-bones
were boiled for thirty-six hours. The turnips and
spare-rib were a present from the Confederate Commissary,
Lieutenant Ross, and came in the very nick of
time. That solitary fowl we had discussed for a mile or
two of our walk back, and had finally determined to put
him in a pie. But the only pie-dish we could procure
was a large tin milk-pan. To have a dish half full of
pie would never do. It was necessary both to have pie
enough and to fill the dish. From Confederate beef we
selected pieces free from fat and grizzle, and then took
the fowl and chopped him up bones and all. The beef
was also chopped, and the two mixed thoroughly together.
The fragments of bone, to which some prejudiced
housewives would have objected, were of great value to
us in establishing the authenticity of the pie; for a man
who, with every mouthful he took, pricked his tongue on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>a splinter of chicken bone, could not doubt (if he were a
reasoning creature) that he was eating chicken pie.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next, and perhaps the greatest achievement of our
art, was in the currant and cranberry line. We made,
after many experiments, a strong decoction of sumach.
Into this we stirred flour, slightly browned to reduce its
color and take off the raw taste. When this mixture was
properly sweetened and cooled it made a dark, pasty
substance, looking and tasting precisely like poor currant
jelly. The cranberry sauce was more difficult, and involved
repeated experiments. Finally a handful of dried
peaches was chopped up, so that when cooked the pieces
would appear about the size of cranberries. To get rid
of their peach flavor, we soaked them and boiled them
and drained the water off, and then cooked them slightly
in a decoction of sumach, and added sugar in the usual
way. Although every one must have known that there
were no cranberries in Texas, yet no one dared to question
the reality of this dish. It was not cranberry, but
it was so like cranberry that they could not imagine
what else it could be, and feared to betray their ignorance.</p>

<p class='c011'>A shrewd observer will have noticed the fact that our
invaluable peaches nowhere appeared on the bill of fare.
Indeed they were very carefully kept out of sight, and
did duty in the secret service. Those mince pies! They
were made of peaches—of peaches and mince-meat, well
flavored, and moistened with cider-vinegar. I cannot
assert that they were poor, for we had no other mincepies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>wherewith to compare them; I cannot deny that
they were good, because they were all eaten up. The
proof was in their favor.</p>

<p class='c011'>The big pumpkin that we carried under one arm till
benumbed, and on one shoulder till a stiff neck for life
threatened us, was a very useful vegetable. In one
course it appeared as squash; in another as pumpkin,
and in a third as pear. The chief cook recollected having
seen or heard of pumpkin preserves, and our early
experiments pointed to ultimate success. To succeed,
however, the simplest common sense told us we must
have a name for our invention. To call it <i>pumpkin
sweatmeats</i> would ruin it. We knew that guava jelly
and preserved ginger must become bankrupt under such
a label. Accordingly we cut the pumpkin in pieces,
like those of a quartered pear; we stewed it till it was
not quite done (a little tough where the core ought
to be); we spiced it with sassafras, prickly-ash, a few
cloves, and the last half of a nutmeg, and we called it
pear-preserve.</p>

<p class='c011'>It will be remembered that I alluded to a gigantic
cake, beautifully brown without and richly yellow
within. This magnificent work of art, truth compels me
to say, was a failure. Its golden richness was not due to
eggs but to corn-meal. We mixed a dodger with some
flour, to give consistence, and some sugar, to give sweetness.
We baked it at the right time and in the right
manner. We sliced it up, and daubed the slices over
with artificial currant jelly. We went a step farther,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>and called it cake. We even varied the name of the
cake, to meet the prejudice or fancy of the particular
guest about to be helped. But vulgarly speaking, “it
was not a go.” We could cheat our guests through the
medium of their eyes and ears in many things, but we
couldn’t cheat them on dodger. When they tasted
dodger, they recognized dodger. Dodger for breakfast,
dodger for dinner, and dodger for supper, in the course
of half a year, makes a deep impression on the human
mind. A little sugar and jelly were wholly inadequate
to smooth it away. Here, then, in the very flush of
victory, we were in danger of suffering a shameful
defeat. Earlier in the dinner we could have brought up
fresh forces, but now, in the hope of making the affair
overwhelming, we had thrown our last reserve into
action. A retreat was ruin, and an instant of hesitation
would have acknowledged a defeat. In less than an
instant we turned the retreat into a flank movement.
Captain Dillingham, with naval effrontery, gave the
cake a new name, and called it a <span class='sc'>Joke</span>!</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus ended this great dinner. Our guests retired
from it wiser and better men. A profound sensation
was followed by a healthy excitement. Manufactures
sprang up and trade began. Some gentlemen made
caps from rags, and hats from straw. Others built a
gymnasium for amusement, and others engaged in gardening
for recreation. A few musicians manufactured
banjoes, tanning the parchment and preparing the
strings in camp. One officer, possessed of a worn-out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>file, a large screw, and a couple of old horse-shoes,
ground the file into a chisel, and turned the screw and
worn-out horse-shoes into a good turning lathe. Another
changed this lathe from half-action to full-action.
A third made for it a crank and foot-treadle. A fourth
built an entirely new lathe, better than the first. And
thus affairs went on until we numbered more than forty
articles of camp manufacture made, chiefly, like our
dinner, out of nothing.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>X.<br /> <span class='large'>ESCAPE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Through illness, changes, toil and trouble, the subject
of escape never left our minds. At Camp Groce, weakness
and ill-health constantly postponed intended attempts.
Moreover, the open prairie country around the
camp, the nearness of the coast-guard, and, above all,
the absence of any point or outlet to which to run, were
disheartening obstacles. At Camp Ford, it was somewhat
different; for the woods came down nearly to the
stockade, and the country was one vast forest.</p>

<p class='c011'>The troubles that beset the path of an escaping prisoner
in Texas were entirely different from those which
would attend him in the Northern States. The difficulty
of passing the stockade and guard was trivial;
the difficulties of crossing the surrounding country were
not insurmountable; but after hundreds of miles were
traversed, and weary days and nights had exhausted the
body and dulled the mind, then the chief obstacles began.
Two hundred miles to the south was the Texan
coast-guard. One hundred and fifty miles to the east
were the carefully watched lines of the Red River and
Atchafalaya. To the north were the rebel Cherokees
and the open Indian country. Five hundred miles west
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>of us stretched desolate prairies, and beyond them were
the scouts that watched and guarded the Rio Grande.
In short, when we studied the map, we saw no city of
refuge to which we might flee; when the stockade was
scaled and the pursuit evaded, there was still no outlet of
escape. Further than this, the chances of re-capture were
many. To look over the wide extent of country with its
sparse population, its scattered plantations, its remote
towns, and talk of pursuing prisoners would seem as idle
as searching for needles in a haystack. But every road
was watched, every river was guarded. Every man
or woman or boy who was not a secret Unionist was
in effect a Confederate patrol; the entire State was one
great detective police, constantly pursuing prisoners,
refugees and slaves.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet, after calmly contemplating these difficulties, the
greater part of the prisoners at Camp Ford determined
to escape. Perhaps the determination was quickened
and extended by annoyances which began soon after our
arrival, and which steadily increased. There are said to
be “bad streaks” in all countries, and Tyler is situated in
a very bad streak of Texas. The inhabitants were poor,
ignorant and narrow-minded, and viewed, with angry
ill-will, the liberality of Colonel Allen. They poured in
complaints at head-quarters, and the result was, that
one fine morning, the poor Colonel received a reprimand
for his liberality, and strict orders not to let us out of the
stockade.</p>

<p class='c011'>The kindness of Colonel Allen and his amiable wife
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>was not lessened by its unpopularity. Regularly, every
afternoon, Mrs. Allen came within the stockade, accompanied
by a little black girl bearing a basket. Sometimes
she brought in visitors, partly to amuse us and
partly to soften them. She was tireless in every work
that could add to our comfort. She cheered the despondent
and comforted the weak, and for the sick,
showed that beautiful solicitude that no one save a Christian
woman can evince.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a little paper then in camp, printed with
the pen by Captain May, of the 23d Connecticut, which
was read successively in the “shebangs,” and shortened
the hours and occupied the mind. It had much <i>local</i> wit
and humor, but so blended with the inner life of Camp
Ford, that the outside world can never understand its
hits and jests. Yet frequently the <i>Old Flag</i> rose above
satire and humor, and it enabled Lieutenant-Colonel Duganne
to pay to Mrs. Allen the following graceful
tribute:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>When the minds of many men are given wholly to
one subject, it is incredible how many expedients they
can devise. Yet no expedient could be devised to comply
with one condition which the calmer judgments imposed,
and which was thus allegorically expressed by
one of our friends in the guard, “When General Green
spreads his tents, there will be plenty of good recruits
join him;” which meant, “You had better wait till the
leaves are out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At length, in the latter part of March, ere the buds
were fully blown, the impatience of fifteen officers broke
through their discretion. They divided into three parties,
and made their preparations carefully. Old haversacks
were mended, and new ones made. Suspicious
articles of dress were exchanged. Some beef was saved
and dried; hard-tack was baked, and panola made.
This last article was recommended by the Texans. It
consists of corn-meal browned to about the color of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>ground coffee, with a liberal allowance of sugar stirred
in. Its advantages are that it requires no cooking, and
contains a large amount of nutriment in proportion to
its bulk and weight.</p>

<p class='c011'>The parties were soon ready to start. But the Texan
atmosphere is dry and clear, with cloudless nights. One
evening, while the colors of sunset were still glowing
upon the western sky, an officer came to me, and pointing
to a black cloud that was rising from the horizon,
said, “If that cloud comes up overhead, we will make
the attempt.” It was a bad hour, in every way; for
darkness had not yet succeeded day, and the moon was
already throwing her pale light upon the eastern clouds.
Yet this cloud might not come again for weeks, and its
dark shadow was too precious to be lost.</p>

<p class='c011'>A gay party assembled in the “shebang” nearest to
the southern side of the stockade. They had a fiddle
and banjoes and castanets, and all the vocal minstrelsy
of the camp. They roared Irish songs, and danced
negro break-downs, and the little cabin shook with the
tumult of their glee. Down at the farther corner of the
enclosure, where all was gloom and quiet, two men
crawled on the ground to the stockade. They were
about thirty feet apart, and a rope lay between them.
The sentry on the outside heard the merriment in the
“shebang,” and as all was quiet on his beat, he walked
up to look at the Yankee’s fun. He passed the two men.
The second twitched the rope; the first quickly rose,
and dug with all his might. A few minutes, and the hole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>was deep enough to allow a post of the stockade to be
canted over, so as to leave a narrow aperture between it
and its neighbor. The man laid down his spade, signalled
to some one behind him, and began to squeeze
himself through the opening. Fourteen others rose from
the ground, and one by one, trembling with impatient
eagerness, pressed through and followed him. They
crossed the sentries’ path, ran up a little hill that fronted
the stockade, and disappeared beneath the trees beyond.
The second of the two men still lay upon the ground.
The last of the fifteen was to have twitched the rope,
and this man was to have replaced the post. But who,
at such a time, ever looked behind to see if he were last?
The signal was not given! Within the “shebang” still
rose the racket, and still the sentry stood grinning at the
Yankee antics. But from the other direction came the
tramp of the next guard-relief!</p>

<p class='c011'>Among those who waited and listened, and saw nothing,
there was intense suppressed excitement. In vain
one or two moved round, begging the little groups to
break up—to stifle their earnest whispers—to resume the
ordinary hubbub of the evening—to laugh—to sing—to
do anything. In vain a young lieutenant, who was both
a wit and vocalist, burst forth with—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Roll on, silver moon!</div>
      <div class='line'>Light the traveller on his way.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The groups broke up, but re-formed; the whispers stopped
for a moment, and then went on.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>The corporal of the guard halted his relief, and could
be seen observing the opening of the leaning post. There
was a little pause, and then a light came down to the
suspicious opening. There was a little longer pause—a
slight stir through the guards’ quarters, and then a
squadron of cavalry rode out, and an officer, with four
or five men, went at a gallop down the Tyler road.</p>

<p class='c011'>The black cloud seemed to be the fugitives’ friend;
for at this moment of discovery it poured down a heavy
shower. We retired to our cabins, and felt some little
relief in the hope that the friendly cloud had washed
away the trail. Some time passed—perhaps two hours,
and our hope had well-nigh turned into belief; when,
from the Tyler road, a low, wailing, ominous cry smote
upon our ears. “Did you hear that?” each asked of
the other, in startled whispers. “Yes; the <i>bloodhounds</i>!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The hounds came down to the stockade. They snuffed
and moaned for a moment around the opening, and then
ran straight up the bank and under the trees. There
lay the trail. We listened until their faint baying could
be heard no longer. Of all the dismal sounds that mortal
senses were ever laden with, none more melancholy
than the baying of these hounds was ever heard. We
passed the uneasy night in speculating upon the chances
of the three parties, and in trying to imagine the feelings
of our friends when they should first hear the foreboding
wail behind them, and surmise that the bloodhounds
were upon their track.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>Yet the next morning the prospect appeared brighter.
Three showers of rain had fallen during the night;
twelve hours had passed since the escape, and we felt
confident that the hounds must have lost the scent.
The day passed in growing cheerfulness, and at taps no
tidings had come. We went to our quarters, sure that
all had been successful. About nine o’clock that evening,
the door of my “shebang” opened, and Lieutenant-Colonel
Leake, of the 20th Iowa, entering, presented,
with mock formality, Lieutenant Lyon, of the 176th
New York. He and his party had been recaptured.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were still eleven officers out, who, we knew,
were divided into two parties. Twenty-four hours must
have passed before the hounds could have taken their
trail, and every hour dissipated the scent. The second
day passed without news. So did the third evening,
and the morning of the third day. Then, about noon,
word was passed in from the guard-house that nine more
were caught.</p>

<p class='c011'>In an hour or two, they came, close packed on the
bottom of a wagon. We waited with some anxiety the
reception they would meet with at head-quarters. Colonel
Allen came out, shook hands with one or two,
laughed, and manifestly treated the affair as a joke.
The wagon started for the gate. Its way lay through
the quarters of the guard, who had, of course, turned
out to look at the runaway Yanks. We waited in the
painful expectation of hearing a Texan yell over the
misfortune of our friends. To their honor be it known,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>the Texan’s showed no ill-mannered exultation. But the
instant it was settled that no shout of triumph was to be
raised by the victorious rebs, there was a revulsion of
feeling in the prison community. As the gate opened, a
slight, restless stir ran through the crowd. As the
wagon drove in, a loud shout arose (couched in expressive
Texan slang) of, “Here’s your mule! Here’s your
mule!” The runaways smiled feebly, as men do who
are the victims of a joke. The crowd laughed boisterously,
and gave excellent imitations of the baying
of hounds. About the same time, a little three-year-old,
the child of a commissary-sergeant, came out on the
bank opposite to us, and in shrill tones piped out,
“Yankee ran away! Yankee ran away!” And all the
afternoon, the little wretch would come, at short intervals,
and re-sing his refrain, “Yankee ran away!
Yankee ran away! Yankee ran away!”</p>

<p class='c011'>When we came to collate the stories of the three
parties, and of their captors, we gathered the following
account: each party had kept secret its intended movements;
yet all had selected substantially the same route.
Unluckily for them, their trails crossed, and, still more
unluckily, there rode with the Confederates an old western
trapper, whom the men called Chillicothe. When
the first party was captured, the pursuers merely returned
to the crossing of the second trail, and followed it up.
In like manner, when they had captured the second
party, they only came back to the third trail. At these
crossings, the prisoners could see nothing; but to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>eyes of Chillicothe and the instinct of the dogs, the two
trails were as plain as the crossings of two streets. The
trapper told the prisoners where they had been, and
nearly everything they had done. He showed them
where (unknowingly) they entered a swamp by the
same opening, and crossed a stream on the same tree.
He pointed out to them the spot where they sat down
to rest, and the hill up which one climbed to reconnoitre.
He described to them a log where one pulled off
his boots, and another lit his pipe. A secret history of
their movements seemed to be written upon the ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>The story of the last party captured was this: they
marched rapidly all of the first night, and hid themselves
through the first day. At dark, they resumed their
march, and continued to travel rapidly through the woods.
On the second morning, they selected, as a hiding-place,
a narrow gully, roofed over and completely hidden by a
fallen tree. The barking of dogs and crowing of cocks
told that a plantation was near. In the afternoon, two
restless members of the party insisted on going there to
buy eggs. Hardly had they gone, when, in the opposite
direction, was heard the baying of hounds. Yet
there were no fears of being tracked, for forty-four hours
had passed since the party left camp. The baying came
nearer. Still it was thought that a party of hunters were
accidentally coming that way. A number of horsemen
rode down to the little brook at the foot of the hill, and
paused there to water their steeds. The dogs, at the
same time, started, and came directly up the hill. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>beautiful dark hound led the pack, and when he reached
the tree, he mounted it with his fore-feet, and looked intelligently
down on the prisoners. They remained quiet,
fearing that some growl or bark might betray them, yet
hoping the hounds would pass on. The leader turned,
and quietly trotted down the hill. He went, not to his
owner, but to the lieutenant who commanded the party;
he looked a moment at him, and then turning looked toward
the fallen tree. The lieutenant instantly shouted,
“Here they are!” All of his men drew their pistols,
and spurred their horses up the hill. The tree was surrounded,
and the fugitives recaptured.</p>

<p class='c011'>What became of the two remaining officers was a
question with us for many weeks. The unerring hounds
had started on their trail, but the lieutenant who commanded,
had ordered that they should be called off. He
did not know how many prisoners had escaped, and
moreover, he had already caught two parties of four each.
Therefore, when he found five prisoners in the gully, he
naturally concluded that they were all. Several weeks
after this, a quotation from a New Orleans paper assured
us of their safe arrival within our lines.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first fact impressed upon us by these adventures
was the wonderful power and sagacity of the bloodhounds.
During the next three months, a long list of
experiences re-taught this lesson. The Confederates
possessed in them “pursuing angels,” whose powers exceeded
those of men. If you buried yourself in the
earth, they dug you out. If you climbed a tree, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>came and stood at the foot. If you plunged into trackless
wilds, they followed you. If you threw yourself
into a stream, and threaded its windings for miles, they
passed tirelessly up and down its bank, until they came
to the spot where you had left it. As every means that
ingenuity could devise failed, and as prisoner after prisoner
who tried them was recaptured, there gradually
grew up, in our minds, a feeling that to be hunted by
these brutes was like being pursued by dreadful phantoms,
such as we read of in old stories, which no mortal
power could outstrip or elude, if their insatiate chase
once began.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the time of the escape of the fifteen, a number of
officers were secretly engaged in “tunnelling out.”
There were two plans connected with this tunnel. The
first was that all who wished to escape should pass out
on the same night and then scatter in small parties. We
knew that some of these parties would be caught—we
also thought that some would escape, and every man
hoped that he would be in a lucky party. The second
plan rested in the breasts of but three or four officers,
and they hardly ventured to speak of it to each other.
It was that on some dark night we would pass all able-bodied
men out, form them in the neighboring woods,
march boldly down the road, and surprise the guard in
their quarters; then after burning the Confederate arsenal
and workshops at Tyler, we would seize upon horses
sufficient to mount the party, and push without ceasing
for the Sabine and our lines beyond.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>About one hundred feet beyond the north side of our
enclosed camp stood two large trees. The spot was
known as the “Quartermaster’s Grave,” for there slept
Lieutenant John F. Kimball, Quartermaster of the
176th New York. The grave, carefully enclosed by a
wicker fence, was between the two trees. The sentries’
walk was close to the stockade and parallel to the grave.
Within our enclosure the “shebangs,” though not built
upon any plan, had nevertheless sprung up with somewhat
of the regularity of streets. One, however, called
from its Indiana owners, the Hawk-eye, stood detached,
and only about sixteen feet from the stockade. This
cabin was taken for our starting point. In one corner a
shaft was sunk eight feet in depth and length by
four in width. From the bottom of this shaft the tunnel
started. It was just high enough for a man to sit erect
and work, and just wide enough for two men to meet
and pass by each other. Two men worked in it at the
same time, the one excavating and the other removing
the earth. Their tools consisted of an old sword-bayonet,
a broken shovel and a small box.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first difficulty met was in establishing the grade
and direction of the tunnel. The top of it at the shaft
was less than five feet below the surface, while the posts
of the stockade stood four and a half feet deep. It was
necessary to go well below them, and therefore necessary
to start with a descending grade. Beside the
Quartermaster’s grave were three others. They projected
over a line drawn from the shaft to the largest tree,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>and we designed that the tunnel should come out through
the roots of this tree like a fox-earth. The wicker fence
with the trunk and shadow of the tree, formed so perfect
a screen from the sentries that a hundred men could
have passed out on a stormy night with only remote
chances of detection. Yet as the graves projected over
the line I have mentioned, it was necessary for us to deflect
from our true course until we should pass them, and
then turn and work toward the tree. To bore under
ground in the dark, and hit such a mark as the tree could
not be done by chance or guess-work. We also must
know the exact distance of the point where we should
turn from our deflecting course; for if we turned too
soon we should run into the graves, and if we turned too
late we should shoot beyond the tree.</p>

<p class='c011'>The difficulty of grade and direction was speedily disposed
of. A pocket-compass and a small vial were soon
procured, and Mr. Johnson, engineer of the gun-boat
“Diana,” with admirable skill combined them into a good
surveyor’s compass and level. The direction of the tree
was taken, the amount of our deflection estimated, and
the compass-level handed to the workmen with orders to
keep on a certain grade and course.</p>

<p class='c011'>To ascertain the exact distance of the tree was a harder
task. For this three methods were suggested. It was
first proposed that an officer should go out for wood, and
as he passed this part of the stockade, some one should
request him to copy the inscription on a head-board.
He would then come up to the stockade for a pencil, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>thence walk directly to the tree, counting his steps as
he went. The objection to this was that it might excite
suspicion, and draw attention to the tree.</p>

<p class='c011'>The second method was to form an interior triangle,
which should be equal to an imaginary exterior triangle.
To do this it was indispensable that we should have “a
given angle” and a “given side” of each. Our pocket-compass
was too small to take angles, and moreover this
had to be done literally within a few inches of the sentries
and before their eyes. It was advisable, therefore,
to measure and establish our given angle without instruments,
and in the most artless manner.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now every body possessed of a smattering of geometry
knows that in a right-angled triangle the square of
the hypothenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the
other sides. Yet very few people can turn that knowledge
to any practical account. This theorem, however,
enabled us readily and accurately to establish a right-angle,
and to use it as our “given angle.” It was done
in this way: we took a cord and measured off and marked
with pins, ten feet, eight feet, and six feet. By squaring
these numbers it will be seen that 10<sup>2</sup> = 8<sup>2</sup> + 6<sup>2</sup>.
Hence by bringing our line into the shape of a triangle
(the pins designating the angles), we formed of it a right-angled
triangle.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>
<img src='images/i186.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c011'>It was not to be supposed that a Texan sentry, seeing
us measuring with a cord on the inside of the stockade,
would ever dream that we were measuring distances on
the outside. Yet it was desirable that our measurements
should be few and quickly done. After thus marking
the line, and also measuring upon it twenty feet, Captain
Torrey, of the 20th Iowa and myself, carried it up to the
Hawk-eye cabin, dropped it on the ground, and quickly
drew it into the form of the little triangle—A J K.
As soon as the side A J came on a line with the tree,
one of us glanced along the other side A K and noted
the point B where its projection struck the stockade.
He then quickly measured twenty feet in this direction,
and stuck a peg in the ground at C. He measured
twenty feet more and placed another peg at D. Here
we re-set the triangle, which gave us the new direction
D E. One of us then walked down this course till he
found himself on a line with the peg C and the tree.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>Here we placed another peg, F. We then picked up
the cord and came away. When the guard was relieved,
and a new set of sentries stood around the stockade, we
went back and measured the distance from F to D. It
was equal to the distance from the cabin to the tree.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i187.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c011'>The third method was suggested by Captain Torrey.
It was to take the altitude of a triangle by trigonometry.
A table of logarithms remaining in the possession of a
naval officer, enabled us to do this. Captain Torrey laid
off the base of his triangle well down in the camp, out
of sight of the sentries. To measure the angle at A he
described a circle on the back of a large chess-board, and
divided it as accurately as he could into degrees. When
the altitude B T was thus obtained, all that remained
necessary to be done was to measure the distance from
the base to the corner of the “shebang” (B C), and subtract
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>it from the altitude B T.  The results obtained by
these two methods were substantially the same.</p>

<p class='c011'>A great deal of earth comes out of such a hole. It
was estimated that we brought out two cart loads a day.
For the first day or two our plan was simply to carry it
from the cabin after dark. Now this might escape notice,
but if it once attracted observation, and that observation
should continue from night to night, detection
was certain. The boldest course is always the safest,
and therefore it was determined that all the earth should
be carried out in broad daylight. Accordingly a number
of officers were detailed for this work. They never
went for a bucket of water without filling the bucket
with earth; none carried out a bag or basket empty.
Little by little, the contents of the tunnel were distributed
around the camp. Some was thrown in the paths and
trampled down—some in the ravine, and covered with
ashes, and some was used to bank up “shebangs.” It
was scattered so perfectly that many of our own number
were at a loss to know what had become of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>A sentinel constantly watched the gate. When any
Confederate visitor entered, a signal was given, the
work stopped within the tunnel, and a blanket was
spread over the shaft. Yet all these precautions did not
satisfy our anxiety. The ingenious engineer of the
“Diana” was again called in. He skilfully arched over
the shaft, leaving a hole at one end, over which he placed
the meal-box of the Hawk-eye. The bottom of this box
was movable. When work was suspended in the tunnel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>the bag of meal and cooking utensils were thrown into
the box, and it became as honest a looking box as a man
could have. When work was to begin again the box
was emptied, the bottom was lifted out, and there appeared
a dark hole, through which a man could drop
down into the shaft below.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet still our anxiety grew with the work. We knew
that if suspicion ever fell on any “shebang” it would
fall on this one. We, therefore, determined to push a
sap to an inner cabin, and pass all the earth through to
the less suspicious building. A wet morning gave us a
pretext for digging a trench. The trench was speedily
roofed and covered with earth. When fully completed,
one end of it entered the shaft, and the other opened in
the second “shebang.” The operation then was this:
a workman in the tunnel filled a small box with earth;
a second one in the shaft drew out the box, and lifted it
into the “baby-jumper” (as the sap was called); a third
drew it through, and emptied it in the second “shebang.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet all this precaution was deemed insufficient. The
“baby-jumper” was enlarged so that a man could crawl
through; the box was removed, and the shaft was covered
over entirely. On the very day that this was completed,
the gate suddenly opened, and Colonel Allen
came in. He walked rapidly to the Hawk-eye (whither
he had never gone before), and contrary to his invariable
custom, entered it unasked and unannounced. He
saw only a bare earth floor.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>It was plainly desirable that information of the projected
movement should be sent to our army, and accordingly
a message to that effect was duly forwarded
to our lines by the Confederate authorities in the following
letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class='c011'>“Letters came yesterday for some
of• us•, and it will please J—— to know that hers did
not <i>escape</i> this time. About a dozen of us have had
letters containing news to 15th ult. There were two from

On the whole <i>we</i> will not complain of our luck. I
am even willing to scatter them more equally amongst the
prisoners, and indeed to let others have a few of mine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We feel certain the blockaders

three times. Let F—— look out• for them. Some

these months. Those which go <i>by Shreveport</i> and Red River

<i>some</i> cases.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stevenson (as I wrote to you) whom
we left sick at Iberia, is here nearly well. Let
his family know this.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c011'>The key to this letter had been previously sent out by
an exchanged prisoner. It early became apparent that
secret correspondence might be useful to us and of advantage
to the government. But it was necessary that
it should be both secret and unsuspected. An ordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>cipher would have been as worthless as any contraband
letter. My first idea was to take a certain word of every
line to convey the hidden message. But this I found
lengthened the letter too much, and I therefore added to
these every blotted and underscored word. If a person
were sure that his correspondent knew the key, and if
he were allowed to coin facts and write nonsense,
this correspondence would be easy enough. But it became
somewhat difficult when written under the following
conditions; viz., 1. To write briefly; 2. To use such
words and subjects as a prisoner in that camp would
naturally use; 3. To state in the body of the letter the
personal information I wished to communicate; for I was
never sure my key had reached my correspondent.
Yet a very little practice removed much of the difficulty,
and for six months, every letter carried out its twofold
intelligence. If now the reader will collate the fifth
word of every line, the words marked thus• and those in
<i>italics</i>, the inner meaning of the foregoing letter will become
apparent.</p>

<p class='c011'>News now arrived of the advance of our army up the
Red River. The leaves were coming out, and the time
was slowly approaching when we expected to use the
tunnel. The officer who had been selected to direct the
work, well know that when this time should arrive it
would be absolutely impossible to prevent the whole camp
from talking of it, and that one careless word might ruin
everything. He therefore sought to conceal the real
situation of the affair, by concealing the real distance to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>the tree, and under-rating the amount of work actually
performed. Every precaution was taken to divert attention
from the progress of the work; for the inspection of
the shrewd Colonel betokened that some foolish word
had been overheard by the sentries, or else that we had
a secret spy in camp. There were then a few straggling
privates within the stockade, and suspicion pointed at
two of these. A constant watch was kept upon them;
and orders were given that all conversation on the subject
should cease.</p>

<p class='c011'>The night of the fifteenth of April would be the first
on which the moon would rise late enough for a sufficient
number of men to pass out; and on the fifteenth of April
it was designed that the tunnel should be finished and
the sally made. On the ninth, news arrived that a great
battle had begun at Mansfield. On the tenth, rumors
came, saying that the Confederate General had possessed
sufficient courage to move forward and strike our invading
army. On the eleventh, we heard that he had struck
it in detail, routing it and driving it back toward Alexandria.
On the thirteenth, Colonel Allen received orders
to prepare for four thousand new prisoners. On the
fifteenth, the stockade was moved back six hundred feet,
and our unfortunate tunnel left high and dry in the middle
of this new enclosure.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The work upon the tunnel was interrupted for a day
by an event, which I think must be without a parallel
in any other prison-camp. At the breaking out of the
rebellion, Miss Mollie Moore was a school girl of sixteen.
After Galveston was re-taken by the Confederates,
the “Houston Telegraph” was adorned with
several heroic ballads, written by the young lady,
whom the editor sometimes called “our pet,” and sometimes
the “unrivalled star of Texan literature.” The
42d Massachusetts had been quartered in a warehouse
on the wharf of Galveston, and had passed the night
previous to their capture in fighting, all of which the
ballad described thus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Beneath the Texan groves the haughty foemen slept.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The literary taste of a simple, half-educated people is
never very high, and it is not surprising that this childish
composition so nicely equalled the taste of its readers,
as to be deemed a marvel of genius, and actually to be
published with General Magruder’s official report. Miss
Mollie became the literary genius of Texas, and her
effusions were poured forth through the “Houston
Telegraph” and the “Tyler Reporter” and the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Crocket
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Quid Nunc</span>” in most lavish streams. This strong incentive
to write, and these ready opportunities to publish
were not altogether abused by the young authoress,
who rapidly improved. Judging her by the other poems
that adorned those papers, she indeed appeared to be
the “unrivalled star of Texan literature.” I am fortunate
in being able to introduce her to northern readers
by an extract from:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>There was a young lieutenant among the prisoners
given to collecting all sorts of scraps and curiosities, and
so he addressed a note to Miss Mollie, begging for her
autograph and copies of any poems she might be able to
spare. Within a reasonable time there came a copy of
the “Invitation” and an autograph of the “Black
Flag,” and a reproachful letter to Lieutenant Pearson.
There was also a letter to Colonel Allen, not intended
for Yankee reading. It expressed a little repentance for
writing so cruelly to an unfortunate prisoner—avowed
a wish to treat even invaders with politeness, and wound
up with the Eve-like conclusion, “But I could not
resist the temptation. Yours truly, <span class='sc'>Mollie E. Moore</span>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>One or two other causes at the same time combined
to induce Miss Mollie to visit Camp Ford, and one lucky
morning Mrs. Allen escorted her in. She was one of
those girls that men are a little afraid of, and that
other girls do not like; she had a slender figure, a thin
face, light hair, light blue, dreamy eyes, and she was
accompanied by the object of the “Invitation.” There
was not much of the poetess in her bearing, for she was
very neatly dressed, a ready talker, and quite sharp at
repartee. Yet when Colonel Burrill was presented to
her as one of the “haughty foemen,” she colored,
and showed a little pretty embarrassment. The friend
was her exact opposite, with dark hair, dark eyes, very
shy and silent and reserved, and much the prettiest
Texan it was ever my luck to see.</p>

<p class='c011'>About the same time a second notable incident occurred,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>being no less than a literary contest between prisoners
and the outside world. One of our number had
received some attention from the Houston editor, in
return for which he sent him a few verses, entitled,
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pax Vobiscum</span>.” These lines so exactly accorded with
the yearning for peace, that they awakened great interest,
and after a while were re-published, with the editorial
avowal that they were written by a Yankee prisoner.
Another literary lady, middle-aged, married, and
rather stout (so I was informed), but who called herself
by the infantile name of “Maggie of Marshall,” thereupon
came out with a poem, addressed to “the noble
prisoner,” in which she styled him, “The northern by
birth but the southern in soul,” and urged him to come
straight over and fight on their side. The “noble
prisoner” had no earthly intention of deserting, so he
wrote a second poem for the “Tyler Reporter,” in which
he defined his position. “When Mistress Maggie of Marshall
found that her blandishments were all thrown
away, she became deeply indignant, and immediately
wrote her second poem for the “Reporter,” wherein the
“noble prisoner” was turned into a puritan and a murderer
and a son of Cain, and finally turned adrift with
the contemptuous pity:</p>

<p class='c011'>I cannot speak very explicitly of our last three months.
In telling this story, I have tried to picture only the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>better side of everything, and to make it imprisonment
with the unpleasant parts left out. The story is “the
truth,” but not “the whole truth,” and does not deny or
conflict with the narratives of others. A sense of honor
forbids that the better actions of our late enemies should
be hidden, or that the good and the bad should be condemned
together. Yet I may as well add here, for the
benefit of certain persons, that the respect yielded to a
southern soldier standing by his State, and heroically
fighting for that false belief (in which he was bred),
does not extend to those cowards who, “<i>sympathizing</i>
with the South,” have skulked through the war behind
the generous protection of the United States.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Red River prisoners arrived, and were followed
by numbers from Arkansas. Our soldiers and sailors of
Camp Groce, who, four months before, left us hopefully
sure of their release, came back—I need not say how
sad and disappointed. Our number swelled from a
hundred officers, to forty-seven hundred and twenty-five,
officers, soldiers and sailors. Then followed a quarter of
a year of loathsome wretchedness, beside which, the
squallor and vice of a great city’s worst haunts appeared—and
still appear, too bright and pure to yield a comparison.</p>

<p class='c011'>The healthy character of our camp changed in a single
week. Disease and death followed each other quickly
in. The friendless sick lay shelterless on the ground
around us, the sun scorching and blighting them by
day, and the cold Texan night-wind smiting them by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>night. We walked over the dying and the dead, whenever
we moved, and saw and heard their miseries through
every hour. Beside the gate stood a pile of coffins, reminding
all who went out and came in, of their probable
impending fate. The vice and lawlessness that live
in the vile haunts of cities sprang up and flourished here.
The Confederate troops (idle after their victories on the
Red River) came back to scour the country for deserters;
and our unhappy conscript friends whispered that
escape was hopeless now, and sought to comfort us by
lamenting that no dim prospect of exchange cheered
them. Our kind friends, the Allens, had gone, and the
English Lieutenant-Colonel, who commanded, treated a
few with surly civility, but the great mass with brutal
cruelty. The horrors of these great prison camps are not
yet told—will never be.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is darkest before the dawn. We sat at dinner, one
day, and a sailor, whose nick-name was Wax, came to
the door, and said to his Captain, “The paroling officer,
sir, who was here three months ago, has come back, and
the guards say, there are some of us to be exchanged.”
The Captain thanked the man, and we went on with our
dinner. “I suppose,” some one remarked, “that if exchange
ever does come, the news will come through
Wax;” and then we dropped the subject; for a hundred
times just such stories had been told, and a hundred
times they had proved false. Captain Dillingham
finished his dinner, and said he would go out and see
that officer; perhaps the fellow had brought us some letters.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>The Captain came back in a few minutes, and
said, as cheerily as though he were telling good news for
himself, “You are to go, and I am to stay—none
of us navy fellows to be exchanged.” Our rose had its
thorn.</p>

<p class='c011'>Three days of anxious waiting passed, and we bade
our naval friends farewell. Some of them had been
tried then six months longer than we had been. The
trial of all went on for seven months more. They suffered,
again and again, the sorest pain that can be
inflicted on prisoners of war—the sight of those marching
out who were captured long subsequent to themselves,
and the fear that the injustice comes from the neglect
of their own government. There was thrown upon them
also a strong temptation; for there were desertions, I am
sorry to say, from the army. The deserters were chiefly
foreign born, but not all. The first, indeed, was a young
man in the 2d Rhode Island Cavalry, a native of another
New England State. Yet these sailors never faltered.
If men who have fought bravely in battle, and who have
been faithful through suffering, ever deserved to be welcomed
home with honors and ovations, then did these
sailors of the “Morning Light,” “Clifton,” and
“Sachem.”</p>

<p class='c011'>One thousand of us marched out of the crowded camp,
We inhaled long breaths of the pure untainted air, yet
dared not believe that this would end in exchange. It
was the sixth time that some had marched over the same
road, and we might well be incredulous. There was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>weary marching over burning sand, and the long-confined
men grew weak and foot-sore, before they had
marched an hour. The Confederate officers acted kindly,
but the prisoners had seen chances of exchange lost by
a single day’s delay, and they dragged themselves forward
with a rigor that would have been cruelty had
it been enforced on them. The white sand glaring under
their feet, and the burning sun beating down through the
breathless air, made a fiery ordeal. Shoeless men, with
feet seared and blistered so that the hot sand felt like
coals of fire, tottered along, not faster than a mile an
hour, yet moving steadily. A few wagons, pressed from
the harvest-fields, were covered with the sick and dying,
and thus appearing, on the fifth day, we marched through
the streets of Shreveport.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here three days of insupportable longness awaited us;
for Shreveport had been the dam that had always
stopped prisoners and turned them back. On the fourth
morning we marched on board of the steamboats that
were to carry us down the Red River; and then, when
Shreveport was fairly behind us, we breathed freer, and
for the first time allowed ourselves to hope. At Alexandria
we were stopped and landed, and made to endure
two other days of suspense, but at last we re-embarked
for the point of exchange.</p>

<p class='c011'>The mouth of Red River was the place where our flag-of-truce
boat was to meet us. We reached it before
sunrise, and saw again the muddy current of the Mississippi.
No flag-of-truce boat was in sight. But we saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>two gun-boats that sentinelled the river, and our eyes
rested on the flag that streamed over their decks, and
silently proclaimed to us the still sovereign power of the
United States. A shot from the gun-boats bade us stop.
A small boat was lowered; we saw its crew enter it, and
an officer come over the side; and then it pulled toward
us. The officer inquired the object of the Confederate
flag-of-truce, and told us the disheartening fact that he
had heard nothing of this exchange. Then followed
nine hours; that seemed as though they would never
move away. A crowd of prisoners stood on the upper
deck, their eyes strained on the river. The morning
passed, the afternoon began, and still nothing could be
seen. At two o’clock, a little puff of black smoke
appeared far down the Mississippi, and a murmur ran
through the crowd. An hour crawled away, and a large,
white steamer pushed around a headland of the river,
and came rapidly up against the muddy current. The
strained eyes thought they saw a white flag, but it was
hard to distinguish it on the white back-ground of the
boat. Suddenly the steamer turned and ran in to the
bank below us—the white flag streamed out plainly in
view, and the decks were covered with Confederate
prisoners.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was on the last day of thirteen months of captivity
that I re-entered our lines. All that I had seen and
learnt was contained in about thirty days. Could these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>thirty days have been brought together, they would
have formed an interesting and instructive month. But
beside this one were twelve other months, that were a
dreary, idle waste. They formed a year that had
brought no pleasure, profit or instruction. Some who
entered it young, came out with broken health and
shortened lives; some who had entered it in middle age,
came out with grey hair, impaired memory, and the decrepitude
of premature old age. It was a year that had
taken much from us and given to us little in return. A
year of ever-disappointed hopes, of barren promises, of a
blank and dreary retrospect. Contemplating it, we
might almost reverse the meaning of our gently-chiding
poet:</p>
